To roll to the designated panel, you need to make sure that the eyes on the panel are the same as the eyes on your top, but you change the eyes every time you roll. So, even if you roll honestly, it may not work. When that happens, I recommend that you start over, choose a different puzzle, or get away from &quot;Suikoro&quot; and play another game, or go outside and change your mind.<br><br><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2214480/extras/explanation_image_2.png?t=1668567575" /><br><br>■Change your colors and change your mood!<br>Are your colors white, black and red?

Tsubaki Hata is an asset flip, what Valve calls a "fake game".  The "developer", Unreal Quality Games/Rosa Special Studio, took the [url=https://github.com/Shit-Just-Got-Real-Studios/Jigsaw]Jigsaw[/url] Unity game template/demo from the real developers, Sh*t-Just-Got-Real Studios, changed the name and added a couple (about 3) stock/low effort images of "anime girls", and dumped the result onto Steam.  They're attempting to scam people into buying this, so they can get your money for someone else's work.

It gets worse... the Jigsaw Github template has been shamelessly dumped on Steam by Rosa Special Studio a whopping 64 times.  That's got to be a world record for the most asset flip scams from the same template.  Here's some of them so you can see for yourself:

Take a look... these are all [i]exactly the same game![/i]

"Jigsaw" is just a free Github jigsaw template for Unity mobile apps, and doesn't have any merit as a proper, fully fledged PC game, so this lame copy of that template is impossible to recommend.

Asset flips don't involve any professional game development.  All Rosa Special Studio does here is change the puzzle images and then dump the exact same game with different images onto Steam as a cash grab.  Asset flips like this are harmful to the gaming industry and to Steam because they reduce the visibility that sincerely made indie games should have, and make it harder for gamers to find real games from genuine developers.

Don't reward this morally bankrupt, unethical behaviour from Unreal Quality Games/Rosa Special Studio.
[quote][url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asset_flip]Warning: Asset Flip![/url][/quote]

Tsubaki Hata is an asset flip, what Valve calls a "fake game".  The "developer", Unreal Quality Games/Rosa Special Studio, took the [url=https://github.com/Shit-Just-Got-Real-Studios/Jigsaw]Jigsaw[/url] Unity game template/demo from the real developers, Sh*t-Just-Got-Real Studios, changed the name and added a couple (about 3) stock/low effort images of "anime girls", and dumped the result onto Steam.  They're attempting to scam people into buying this, so they can get your money for someone else's work.

It gets worse... the Jigsaw Github template has been shamelessly dumped on Steam by Rosa Special Studio a whopping 64 times.  That's got to be a world record for the most asset flip scams from the same template.  Here's some of them so you can see for yourself:

Take a look... these are all [i]exactly the same game![/i]

"Jigsaw" is just a free Github jigsaw template for Unity mobile apps, and doesn't have any merit as a proper, fully fledged PC game, so this lame copy of that template is impossible to recommend.

Asset flips don't involve any professional game development.  All Rosa Special Studio does here is change the puzzle images and then dump the exact same game with different images onto Steam as a cash grab.  Asset flips like this are harmful to the gaming industry and to Steam because they reduce the visibility that sincerely made indie games should have, and make it harder for gamers to find real games from genuine developers.

Don't reward this morally bankrupt, unethical behaviour from Rosa Special Studio/Unreal Quality Games.
This is a pretty good quality jigsaw puzzle game at a low price, but there are only five puzzles which is less than some of my other games. A couple of the pictures are really attractive. There are features like allowing you to separate the edge pieces from the other pieces.[quote][url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asset_flip]Warning: Asset Flip![/url][/quote]

Pichi Girl is an asset flip, what Valve calls a "fake game".  The "developer", Rosa Special Studio/Unreal Quality Games, took the [url=https://github.com/Shit-Just-Got-Real-Studios/Jigsaw]Jigsaw[/url] Unity game template/demo from the real developers, Sh*t-Just-Got-Real Studios, changed the name and added a couple (about 3) stock/low effort images of "anime girls", and dumped the result onto Steam.  They're attempting to scam people into buying this, so they can get your money for someone else's work.

It gets worse... the Jigsaw Github template has been shamelessly dumped on Steam by Rosa Special Studio a whopping 64 times.  That's got to be a world record for the most asset flip scams from the same template.  Here's some of them so you can see for yourself:

<CONTENT>
Prehistoric World: A New Beginning is a strategy game set in an open world. As a representative of a private company, you have been given the task of building a complete, functional dinosaur fauna on a newly discovered planet while maximizing your company's profits. You have more than 42 species of dinosaurs to choose from - herbivores, predators, pterosaurs, aquatic dinosaurs.  You have access to many locations on the planet where you can try to revive the Jurassic era. <br><br>You can organize expeditions and hunts for profit, or you can solve situations by landing on the planet yourself. Technology also allows you to control the brain of any dinosaur you have on the planet. You can also breed dinosaurs, sell their eggs, and perform a variety of tasks. There is also a native alien fauna on the planet that you must suppress.<br><br><br><br><strong>STORY</strong><br>66 million years ago, a 15-kilometre asteroid, Chicxulub, crashed into Earth.  The impact of the trillion-ton meteorite was enormously powerful and caused a worldwide ecological disaster. This catastrophe caused the last known mass extinction at the turn of the Mesozoic Era and ended the dominance of the dinosaurs. The impact created a crater 80 kilometres wide and 30 kilometres deep. The impact released enormous energy, resulting in fires, earthquakes and megatsunamis. The worst effects of the impact lasted 30 years. The impact winter that followed the impact lasted more than a century. The entire planet was affected. The disaster wiped out 75 percent of life on Earth.<br><br>By 2190, scientists had deciphered the dinosaurs' DNA and learned to reconstruct it. In 2220, the technology of traveling at the speed of light was discovered and successfully tested.  The exploration and settlement of planets beyond our solar system began.<br><br>In 2362, a private company, ACTAS, found a planet that is 85% similar to our earth from 66 million years ago. The planet was named Hope. The company decided to reconstruct the dinosaur fauna and use it for commercial purposes. The entire planet was declared a protected reserve. Only paying visitors are allowed on the planet. Some private companies have not recognised this move by ACTAS. The company expects huge profits from this unique attraction.<br><br>The first step was to build a space station in the orbit of Hope. Samples of several dozen dinosaurs were brought to the station. The entire planet has been fairly well mapped. Locations were selected for dinosaur settlement where there is less of an abundance of alien species inhabiting the planet. The company has appointed you director of the planetary colonization project. Your task is to build a functional and harmonious fauna on the planet and maximize the company's profits. And here begins your new adventure!

With the programmable robot having a slight difference in each run, your programming decisions become more and more important for the first several lines of codes as those make a huge change by the end of the level.  Not a game I thought I would enjoy, but have found myself playing it all the time when I'm just sitting at the desk.  I really enjoy the way the scenery changes as the levels progress.  Will update as I complete the remaining levels.

<CONTENT>
Introduction to the game:<br>AOI is a 2d horizontal board platform jumping game similar to the Galaxy Warrior Demon City. You will play the little girl AOI to explore a fantastic world,<br>AOI wakes up from sleep and loses her memory. As the game goes on, her memory will be gradually awakened and the truth of the world will emerge.<br><br><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2212390/extras/attac.png?t=1669951134" /><br><br>- This is a single player adventure game, requiring players to jump, fight, and a little decryption.<br><br>- The game process of this work has a certain degree of freedom, mainly in the following two aspects:<br>     *The game maps are connected, and players can select the attack sequence of the map area to a certain extent.<br>     *Players can pass through the game in the initial state, or win gold coins by defeating the enemy, and then go to the store to buy powerful weapons, energy stones and other ways to improve themselves, and then challenge the boss. Players can decide according to their own preferences.<br><br>- The game has challenging levels and Boss battles.<br><br>- Players can carry 3 kinds of weapons at the same time. The attack means of each weapon are completely different, and they can switch instantaneously, so that players can achieve their unique fighting style and freely combine their fighting skills.<br><br>- There is almost no mandatory plot animation in the game. Players who only like jumping and fighting can completely ignore the plot. Players who like the plot can also explore the plot of the game through NPC dialogues and scattered information.<br><br>The game supports the key modification of the handle and keyboard, and has made the corresponding UI prompt adaptation. Players can set according to their own habits. Players can simply use ordinary attack clearance games. You can also choose to match different weapons to achieve the combination of skills, or grasp the opportunity to fight with the enemy to make yourself invincible. In short, the game design concept is to give players enough freedom to choose their own way to experience this wonderful journey.

<GameName>Full Gear</GameName>
<CONTENT>
<i>Songs of steam and bright machines...</i><br><br><strong>Welcome to Full Gear! </strong>This steampunk-style traditional roguelike is all about information: learn new things, die from an unknown attack, repeat. Use goggles, guns and gadgets to get a gain on the gears, and find... whatever you're looking for down there. You keep forgetting your goal, don't you Devi? Eyes on the prize!<br>With more than 200 unique items to equip, throw, shoot, learn and lose, there's plenty of possibilities to crash your wrench into the drones patrolling the area. And sometimes your own drones as well. Featuring:<br><ul class="bb_ul"><li>8 sprawling areas, all in one giant room, to traverse</li><li>48 unique enemies, completely animated in cute pixel art style</li><li>6 NPC's with their own hopes, dreams, aspirations, and make-shift shops</li><li>9 Boosts and 9 Challenges to make the game harder - or easier - at will</li><li>6 main bosses and 1 final boss</li><li>28 Steam achievements!</li></ul><h2 class="bb_tag">Make Your Own Death Machines</h2>Ah, but using a weapon is never quite enough, is it? You need additional firepower! Gather Parts and combine them in any way you like using local Drone Stations, then let the crafted <strong>Drones </strong>roam near you, distracting and eliminating any threat. You can make a killer robot with three flamethrowers moving at lightning speed - or a cute companion with a taser called Randy. Nobody's safe from Randy. <br><br><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2212500/extras/gif4.gif?t=1669725842" /><h2 class="bb_tag">A Turn Of Events</h2>That cogwheel of yours isn't just for decoration, it's your essence. Whenever a <strong>Token </strong>reaches the top, it'll activate whatever it does - heal you, shield you, give a Crit, give Scrap, or allow a Drone to fire. Re-arrange these Wheel Tokens to whatever you see fit, and before you can say &quot;hey watch this&quot; you deal 40 damage in one attack.<br>Not enough slots for your tokens to fit? No big deal! Swap <strong>cogwheels </strong>to get more slots, stacked slots, special tokens or more regeneration to increase your active capacity. But beware - larger cogwheels may have more slots, but consequently, each slot activate less often.<br><br><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2212500/extras/gif1A.gif?t=1669725842" /><h2 class="bb_tag">Block And Unlock</h2>Many items are locked at first, but in-game <strong>Goals </strong>can be tracked to unlock them. How do you get 5 Curse? Deal 30 damage? Use a Reclaimer? The items you gain from completing goals interact with those mechanics heavily! Additionally, you can simply choose Traditional Mode, where all items are unlocked from the start and Goals are purely cosmetic. Excellent for those living the rogue-life.<br><br><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2212500/extras/gif2A.gif?t=1669725842" /><h2 class="bb_tag">Remembered History</h2>You aren't alone. Maybe that's for the best.<br><br><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2212500/extras/gif3.gif?t=1669725842" /><br><br>There's people down here. Actual people, Devi. Maybe they have some information. You'll need every bit of it.<br>They have stories to tell? About mechanics? Good. About the lore? Hm, is that interesting?<br>Are they of use? They clearly have things they can give you. Maybe it's worth your time after all.<br><br>Getting them out of this place?<br>What, are you insane?<br><br><strong><i>See you around.</i></strong>

As she looks for them, she investigates supernatural cases to get her one step closer to her heritage. <br><br>In this narrative-driven game, you will be able to chat with the people in the town, follow the clues, and fill out your journal along the way.

<GameName>Barbelé</GameName>
<CONTENT>
Barbelé is an Action and 3D Fighting, 3rd person game. It's a story driven adventure in a french prison which offers players dialogue choices.<br />
You will have to do your time in prison, survive in a penitentiary with a real in game timer that you can influence with your action. You can make it pass quicker if you can smuggle things like a phone or books in your cell, or you can even add more time if you get caught fighting or doing anything else illegal.<br />
<br />
Barbelé was born under the name “GS project” for “sacrificed generation”. This idea that young immigrants from the projects go through the same thing over and over again. Like a cycle that does not allow you to move forward. Barbelé wants to be an analysis of society, of the police, of justice, of young people in the projects.<br />
The main feature of Barbelé is combat. The goal of the game is to get out of jail. After being sentenced to 2 years in prison, the player will have to try to survive to get out. A system of &quot;timer&quot; present in the game makes it possible to &quot;do your time&quot; to arrive at the moment when you become free. With each fight that you will make in front of witnesses of the penitentiary administration, you will add time to your sentence, you can even be sent to the &quot;hole&quot; for a given time so that you reflect on your actions.<br />
Several ways will be accessible to &quot;do your time&quot; and finally get out of prison. Not making waves and letting yourself be eaten by ill-intentioned prisoners can get you out sooner with reduced sentences or with your feet first... Fighting intelligently will offer you some advantages without risking increasing your time, and on the other hand, constantly fighting will help to establish your position in the prison, make money and easily get a phone in your cell to prepare for the rest of your incarceration. But this can get you into serious trouble, additional penalties that will constantly delay your exit.<br />
The use of the cell phone will be a major component of the game and there too, it will be necessary to learn to identify the guards' rounds and the schedules to know when it is possible to use the phone without risking being caught, which will result in an additional time, the loss of the phone which is very difficult to recover, and a passage to the hole.<br />
There are other ways to get out of jail...

<GameName>Bounty</GameName>
<CONTENT>
A student project made in Unreal Engine 4 at SAE Expression College. A demo level from our game Bounty.<br />
<br />
Bounty is a first-person shooter bounty-hunting game. The player lands on a space station overrun with robotic bounty hunters. The player must locate and kill the bounty. The player is equipped with a six-shooter that shoots explosive rounds. The player fights through the robot bounty hunters to claim the ultimate prize, his reward. The game is a tactical first-person game. The robots are just as deadly as the six shooters the character wields. The player uses a cover system to avoid being shot. The cover system allows the player to return fire in a deadly firefight a little more safely. The game's plot is to create a mix of wild west gunslingers in a future period. The story behind this bounty hunter is that his father owes money to an intergalactic crime syndicate. This bounty is the “last” job for the crime family before he can free his father from his debt or so he thinks. 7 user reviewsReminds me of Dead Space, the cover system is a really cool idea, makes me think, what if Gears of War could move the cover the way Portal does? A quick and easy play that feels tense the first time through.Cool vibe and fun game, gave me a bit of survival horror vibes tbh. It perhaps could've used more of a tutorial because it took me a bit to really "get" what the mechanics were like, for example at the beginning if the game told you how to crouch that would've been nice. Also, a boss fight near the end might have made it cooler. 

But all in all. This is a great prototype and I can't wait to see level two.This game for a collage project is good one problem I had is that there is no HUD in game i died one time because I didn't know how much health i had lost at the moment then i had to restart at the at the beginning overall good job keep up the good work.Walking is too slow, running is too fast, and everything just feels stiff. The devs seem proud of their dynamic cover system, but I never had to use it because bots can't shoot through railings.pros: Interesting atmosphere, well developed, nice particle effects
cons: needs skip-able cut-scenes, needs a story line to captivate players or something to have them return if a full game is being made, needs direction on how to use cover system, tried reloading but couldn't.

keep up the good work!Pleasantly surprised. Moody space shooter with a pounding soundtrack. Both the visuals and music design create a really strong sense of atmospheric tension, excited to see more!Reminds me of Dead Space, the cover system is a really cool idea, makes me think, what if Gears of War could move the cover the way Portal does?

Why? Not the game, although my thoughts have not changed, and about 4 hours is about all the "playing" there is.
It is because the dev has a very similar game, also at a cost that, is in the same state. If they had one game and were working on it? Sure, pay to get it. But this seems like a copy/paste cash grab, which is super sad, since the bones are there..

EDIT2: The devs response did not shine any light on why they released 2 games that are 20% complete, at the same time. My recommendation stays the same. Are you committed to making a good game, or making 2 games that are not really finished and make 2x as much cash? Pretty clear which the devs chose.

This is super beta material. The instructions (in English at least) are not that helpful and only 1 page saying not a lot.
Lots of stuff is not obvious, like only one of the "team" fights at once.
There is no scroll bar on the left, so it is VERY possible you will not notice there are more things to build (looking at you, Uranium!)
I would say I am half way through, and it has got to the point of my income being well high enough to just get each element, spam the buildings, get the next and repeat. Some balancing required.
There is very little in the way of decisions to make. Just make all the things until you need something (has happened twice in 4 hours...), go swap something over and you are done.

So why am I recommending it? Has good bones, I have enjoyed the 4 hours I have into it, and will probably "finish" it in another 4 or so. Tomorrow. :DGood idea for the game but the game is about 20% finished now. There are a lot of different resources but only few of them have specialized machinery, the rest are just copy-paste. Balance is non-existent, some things don't make sense. Why positive review then? Because I enjoyed playing it for 5 hours until it became obvious that it is not finished yet. So if you want to try it for few hours without expecting a full game, I recommend it.

I am not sure if it will be ever finished as their other game - Mining Copper was released two weeks before this one and also has reviews that say it is unfinished (I didn't play it myself) and instead of finishing one game dev released another.

So what is this game about? There are three parts in it: mining, making and exploration.

Mining:
You have several resources and each one has a machinery chain which basically starts from drilling holes, transforming them into tunnels, digging resources, transporting them, processing them into final product (either green/blue energy or just some resource which you store to use in other chains). Each stage in chain produces next resource and can also produce gold. You use gold to upgrade speed and yield of each stage. Some chains don't make sense, for example, you load impure coal into truck making truckload of coal, then unload truckload of coal into more impure coal at warehouse basically making impure coal out of nothing.

Making:
You use green energy to create 5 types of units. Each unit has rank and level. You produce rank 1 units. You can upgrade their level with gold and you can combine two of the same rank into one of the higher rank of the same type. So to create rank 9 unit you need to make 256 rank 1 units. After rank 9 it requires 4 units of the previous rank to make another, so 1024 rank 1 for rank 10, 4096 for rank 11, etc. After you upgrade a unit to a new level with cash you need to craft enough units to at least get it to the same rank before you can use it, luckily if you combine few units, one of which has higher level resulting level will be the highest of them.

Exploration:
You choose 3 unit types and the first unit of those types (usually the strongest unless you reordered them) goes into battle. Each level initially has 10 enemies, one of which is the boss (which increases by 20 each 5 levels). Rightmost unit attacks the enemy, then central unit attacks the enemy, leftmost unit attacks the enemy, and then finally enemy attacks your rightmost unit, so use tanky unit at the rightmost position. If enemy level is higher than your total level of three units then enemy attacks first otherwise you can just kill them before they get a move if your units are strong enough. You get sources of resources as a reward for exploration which are used to produce initial resource in Mining production chains. The further you get the more rare resource sources you find but because there is nothing special about those resources it is still better to just produce initial resources to convert them to green energy and gold. Yes you get more chains but because they cost more to upgrade they end up slower so increase is not very noticable.

And so that's it. Mine resources, produce green energy and gold, spend gold on upgrades, spend energy on crafting new units, combine units, fight.

This cowboy doesn't have legs so he uses his grappling whip to grapple from A to B. When the whip is attached to a grapple point the player will be pulled towards it. Collect all the gems in a level to progress while swinging. Move the crosshair over a grapple point to attach the whip and move forward. Different kinds of grapple points are scattered around the levels and can act differently based on their color. <br />
<br />
Some of the grapple points move to another place so the player can use them as transport and others give the player more velocity to reach more places. Sometimes it can be beneficial to detach from a point at the right moment to reach a gem or a new point. Watch out for rotating and moving spikes and dropping down in the abyss will make you start over but don’t worry you won’t have to collect all your gems again.<br />

While you discover the city and earn money walking / running / driving / cycling / commuting / <i>etc</i> your backpack around, you will face a number of challenges.<h2 class="bb_tag">Keep An Eye On <strong>Temperatures</strong></h2>Depending on the type of items you carry in your backpack, you need to carefully arrange them in such way that frozen pizzas don't melt and nachos cheese sauce doesn't get cold. You can upgrade it to carry more items or even have better temperature insulation.<h2 class="bb_tag">Make Sure You've Got <strong>Change</strong></h2>Some customers will prefer to pay <i>cash</i>, so make sure to manage your wallet contents carefully and don't forget to visit the ATM every now and then. If you don't have exact change, you can either <i>bargain</i> and hope for the best or make the customer wait ... <i>your rating will likely suffer</i>.<h2 class="bb_tag">Grind Your Way Through <strong>Delivoo Partner Program</strong></h2>While short and easy orders are smooth, longer distance ones will pay more. Even better: rush hour and weather conditions also influences your payment.<br>These perks are only available to Delivoo Partners only, so make sure to keep your rating up and customers happy in order to get <strong>bronze, silver, gold or even platinum</strong> Partner Level.<br><i>PS: There's no rating that many can't magically remove</i><h2 class="bb_tag"> Find your way through Peytor Town </h2>The city is large - so large, in fact, that it has a <strong>shore with a beach, a crowded old town, a busy office area, a picturesque mountain road leading to Holywood grade villas and more</strong>. Getting around the city can prove to be complicated, depending on the vehicle you pick:<br><ul class="bb_ul"><li>Your own two feet<br></li><li>Public transportation <i>(You'll need tickets or subscriptions)</i><br></li><li>Bicycle<br></li><li>E-Bike <i>(You'll need to charge it or spend twice the effort to pedal it)</i><br></li><li>Electric scooter<br></li><li>Car <i>(Gas, maintenance, taxes, parking passes, all that jazz)</i><br></li><li>Electric Car <i>(Pick a good one)!</i></li></ul>You can either <strong>rent</strong> or <strong>buy</strong> dozens of vehicles of this type and leave them around town so you can easily switch between them to beat the traffic and deliver that hotdog as it's still steaming hot!

 The story was intriguing and made me think a lot about my own personal struggles with life and thoughts of suicide. 

I was truly enjoying my time with this game until i got about an hour in and couldn't progress. There was a page with a youtube link that i could not decipher despite trying for a good fifteen minutes or so. Disappointing as i was looking forward to seeing how the game would end. 

Overall 6/10

<strong>HEY! This game is still a work in progress, and a LOT is being changed. Stick around for more info!</strong><br><br>Scrapbox is a frantic 2.5D fighter where a bunch of strange specimen beat each other up for little to no reason.<h2 class="bb_tag">ACCESSIBILITY FIRST</h2>Scrapbox was made with casual <i>and </i>competitive play in mind as opposed to leaning super heavily in either direction. The game has very easy inputs consisting of a direction, a button press, and your character's position (in air or grounded) instead of super difficult inputs that take 7.346 trillion years to learn. To make up for the game being easy to control, each character has a boat load of attacks - 8 Light Moves, 8 Mid Moves, 8 Strong Moves, 8 Special Moves and 3 Ultra Moves.<h2 class="bb_tag">SOME TECH, YES</h2>This game has a few ways to cancel moves. There's jump cancelling, which affects everything but Ultras, which is performed by inputting a jump during a small window as you attack. Land cancelling exists too - landing during an aerial cancels it immediately. On top of that, you can air dash in 4 directions, wave dash, dodge roll, and much more!<h2 class="bb_tag">ACHIEVEMENTS GALORE</h2>There are multiple achievements to snag for doing the most bizarre things possible. Every update brings new ones!<h2 class="bb_tag">MODES</h2>Just in case regular fighting gets old, there are a handful of other modes for you to enjoy!<br><br><ul class="bb_ul"><li><strong>TRAINING MODE</strong> lets you, well, train. You can see every character's hitboxes, speed up or slow the game down and more to let you lab with your favourite character!<br></li><li><strong>CAMEO KICKER</strong> has you punting tons of flying discs imprinted with characters that didn't quite make the cut. Good old arcade fun!<br></li><li><strong>TOUR MODE</strong> is the game's platform fighter hybrid, with huge stages and plenty of enemies to smack. Speed through the level or take your time battering each enemy one by one!<br></li><li><strong>CHAOS MODE</strong> throws balancing out the window and randomises every character's attributes. Good luck, have fun!<br></li><li><strong>TAG TEAM MODE</strong> lets you choose up to three different fighters and tag them in and out mid-match. If all three get KO'd, you're out!<br></li><li><strong>STORY MODE</strong> tells the most bizarre story ever seen in a fighting game. 'Nuff said.</li></ul>

<GameName>Polaris Outpost</GameName>
<CONTENT>
You find yourself alone on a remote research outpost in the Polaris system. Something has gone terribly wrong. Much of the base is lacking power and your co-workers are mysteriously missing. There is a deadly threat lurking in this outpost and it will take all of your cunning to keep from becoming another victim.<br><br>Your resources are dwindling, so you'll need to secure more food, water, and power, but this involves venturing away from the security of your home base. Equipped with various items to track, deter, and trick your adversary, there is a chance you can outwit your opponent. However, you'll need to keep a close eye on your stats, as it's all too easy to get dehydrated or lose your sanity to the extreme stress of these circumstances.<br><br>You will need to explore deep into your opponent's territory to find a way to escape this outpost. A distress signal may take too long, so maybe you can get the escape shuttle up and running instead. Or maybe there is a way to actually defeat this adversary. One thing is for certain, this won't be easy. Your adversary is becoming more intelligent by the minute, and it is adapting to resist your weapons. You'll need to move quickly and find more powerful equipment if you expect to stand a chance. Can you survive Polaris Outpost?<br><br><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2209080/extras/Vertical_No_text.png?t=1668453444" /><br><br>Polaris Outpost is a blend of survival, horror, and minimalist base building. It involves both planning ahead and thinking on your feet in order to survive. You will be up against a single powerful adversary that evolves to become stronger and more intelligent throughout the game. You will secure resource production rooms and find ways to defend or repair them. The gameplay is often tense and frightening as you try to out maneuver and outsmart your deadly opponent in a variety of atmospheric sci-fi environments. The game becomes progressively more open-ended, giving you more of a chance to make your own decisions.

A detailed hit simulation and health system will mean that even non-lethal hits can render a survivor unable to go on. Suppressive fire might pin an enemy in place, but the ammunition used up may leave you ill-equipped to fight the next encounter effectively<br><br><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2209140/extras/Explosion_-_Resized.gif?t=1669149424" /><h2 class="bb_tag">DRIVE RESTORED VEHICLES</h2>It's a big world out there. To get around you will need better transportation than your legs can provide. One of the things setting Ascent of Ashes apart from other games of this genre is the ability to restore and drive vehicles.<br><br><br><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2209140/extras/Vehicles_-_Resized.gif?t=1669149424" /><h2 class="bb_tag">LEAD YOUR SURVIVORS</h2>Each survivor has their own unique personality and motivations.

To survive the post-apocalypse you'll have to brave the pre-collapse ruins and the many dangers that they hold.<br><br><br><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2209140/extras/Floaters_-_Resized.gif?t=1669149424" /><h2 class="bb_tag">CHALLENGE A DYNAMIC AI</h2>It's not enough to just have an in-depth combat system with a variety of mechanics. You also need opponents capable of using those mechanics to challenge you. Enemies will possess varying degrees of intelligence. Taking on a disorganized band of raiders will play very differently from fighting a squad of well-trained Remnant soldiers.<br><br><br><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2209140/extras/Dynamic_AI_-_Resized.gif?t=1669149424" /><h2 class="bb_tag">FROM THE ORGINAL CREATORS OF COMBAT EXTENDED</h2>Combining the deep simulation of classic post-apocalyptical survival titles with the tactical challenge of classic real time and turn-based gems, the original creators of RimWorld's heralded <strong>Combat Extended</strong> mod present a fresh take on the colony sim genre that emphasizes exploration, tight balance and strategic gameplay.<h2 class="bb_tag">MODDING SUPPORT</h2>Our team has its roots in mod-making and we've been fortunate to have been part of many great modding communities over the years. That's why with Ascent of Ashes, we want to give something back to those communities. We're building the game's engine from the ground up to be easily extendable, and thanks to our extensive experience in creating mods ourselves we know exactly what kind of support mod-makers need. Ascent of Ashes is a game developed by modders, for modders.

Suddenly forced to spend her waking hours overwhelmed with study and work, her days became a grey blur. After several years of painstaking efforts, Sky had finally finished college. Wanting to celebrate this joyous occasion, Margot - Sky's best friend - barely manages to drag Sky out of her hidey-hole and into a world of frivolous fun. Though, tragedy isn’t the same as lightning and it likes to strike the same person twice.<br><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2208610/extras/Explore.png?t=1670247112" /><br><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2208610/extras/Gif_2.gif?t=1670247112" /><br>Accompany Sky and experience the struggles and difficulties she'll have to face and overcome; the lessons she will have to learn, the things she'll have to risk and sacrifice on a  journey towards the end.

<GameName>Bebop</GameName>
<CONTENT>
Set in a distant future, a dystopian society struggles with crime and prostitution. In a dark alley, a sign on the door reads: &quot;Bebop, private investigator&quot;. But is he a private investigator really? I DON'T THINK SO. Bebop is involved with the mob, and he is about to embark on a journey without return. I mean, he will return home, but NOT THE SAME as before. Bebop will meet people that will shape his personality, he will go after those who wronged him, and he will, in the end, reach the end of his story. OR IS HE?<br />
<br />
This amazing adventure was written by Luis Felipe Pimenta, in his first attempt at creating a game. Hopefully, it won't be his last. His team is made of programmers doing artwork and artists doing programming.<br />
<br />
Bebop is a platform side-scroller pixel art adventure. Use physics to solve puzzles, travel through different places in Cybercity to complete your quests. <br />
<br />
Features:<br />
<br />
- 2D Physics puzzles<br />
- Choices that matter and affect your ending<br />
- Tough ethical decisions to make<br />
- Tightly crafted platforming action and deeply emotional storytelling<br />
- Exploring options: to find hidden levels, equipment and more storytelling<br />

<CONTENT>
In Raiders of Ruin, you guide a group of 5 champions sent on a quest to seize the throne of the Underworld itself. Along the way, you will encounter many deadly bosses and engage in challenging, strategic turn-based combat. You decide how to build your party, mixing-and-matching between 9 different classes, each with drastically different strengths and weaknesses. You can change classes any time, so experiment frequently to craft the perfect strategy for each enemy!<h2 class="bb_tag">Features</h2><ul class="bb_ul"><li>Over <strong>40 boss fights,</strong> each with their own unique mechanics. Expect multiple phases, colourful gimmicks, and ruthless attacks. <br></li><li><strong>No game-overs:</strong> Your progress is saved after every battle. Defeat simply means a chance to try again. <br></li><li>Study your enemies ahead of time by viewing the <strong>Boss Log,</strong> where you can find a record of your greatest foes and a description of their attacks. You must prepare to counter their strategies with a plan of your own!<br></li><li>Class-based combat system that's simple to learn, hard to master. <strong>Swap classes before any battle</strong> to arm yourself for the fight ahead. Find a combo that works for you and stick to it, or experiment frequently to find the perfect squad. <br></li><li><strong>9 main classes to choose from.</strong> Need more firepower? Swap that Paladin for a Wizard. Expecting a long fight? Try poisoning your foe with a Rogue.<br></li><li><strong>Multiple subclasses</strong> for most classes, providing even more customization. Should your Ranger be a Hunter, or a Survivalist?<br></li><li><strong>Innovative rematch system</strong> that replaces traditional level-grinding. Instead of fighting normal enemies repeatedly, you will occasionally be given the opportunity to rematch a boss of your choosing for a second chance at its rewards (though this system is entirely optional). <br></li><li><strong> MIDI soundtrack</strong> inspired by PC games of the early 2000's, with some modern twists. <br></li><li>A backpack that might be alive?</li></ul><br>-------------------------------------------------<br><br><i>&quot;I won't waste my time trying to plead with you.

So, even if you roll honestly, it may not work. When that happens, I recommend that you start over, choose a different puzzle, or get away from &quot;Suikoro&quot; and play another game, or go outside and change your mind.<br><br><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2214480/extras/explanation_image_2.png?t=1668567575" /><br><br>■Change your colors and change your mood!<br>Are your colors white, black and red?

Tsubaki Hata is an asset flip, what Valve calls a "fake game".  The "developer", Unreal Quality Games/Rosa Special Studio, took the [url=https://github.com/Shit-Just-Got-Real-Studios/Jigsaw]Jigsaw[/url] Unity game template/demo from the real developers, Sh*t-Just-Got-Real Studios, changed the name and added a couple (about 3) stock/low effort images of "anime girls", and dumped the result onto Steam.  They're attempting to scam people into buying this, so they can get your money for someone else's work.

It gets worse... the Jigsaw Github template has been shamelessly dumped on Steam by Rosa Special Studio a whopping 64 times.  That's got to be a world record for the most asset flip scams from the same template.  Here's some of them so you can see for yourself:

Take a look... these are all [i]exactly the same game![/i]

"Jigsaw" is just a free Github jigsaw template for Unity mobile apps, and doesn't have any merit as a proper, fully fledged PC game, so this lame copy of that template is impossible to recommend.

Asset flips don't involve any professional game development.  All Rosa Special Studio does here is change the puzzle images and then dump the exact same game with different images onto Steam as a cash grab.  Asset flips like this are harmful to the gaming industry and to Steam because they reduce the visibility that sincerely made indie games should have, and make it harder for gamers to find real games from genuine developers.

Don't reward this morally bankrupt, unethical behaviour from Unreal Quality Games/Rosa Special Studio.

Take a look... these are all [i]exactly the same game![/i]

"Jigsaw" is just a free Github jigsaw template for Unity mobile apps, and doesn't have any merit as a proper, fully fledged PC game, so this lame copy of that template is impossible to recommend.

Asset flips don't involve any professional game development.  All Rosa Special Studio does here is change the puzzle images and then dump the exact same game with different images onto Steam as a cash grab.  Asset flips like this are harmful to the gaming industry and to Steam because they reduce the visibility that sincerely made indie games should have, and make it harder for gamers to find real games from genuine developers.

Don't reward this morally bankrupt, unethical behaviour from Unreal Quality Games/Rosa Special Studio.

Tsubaki Hata is an asset flip, what Valve calls a "fake game".  The "developer", Unreal Quality Games/Rosa Special Studio, took the [url=https://github.com/Shit-Just-Got-Real-Studios/Jigsaw]Jigsaw[/url] Unity game template/demo from the real developers, Sh*t-Just-Got-Real Studios, changed the name and added a couple (about 3) stock/low effort images of "anime girls", and dumped the result onto Steam.  They're attempting to scam people into buying this, so they can get your money for someone else's work.

It gets worse... the Jigsaw Github template has been shamelessly dumped on Steam by Rosa Special Studio a whopping 64 times.  That's got to be a world record for the most asset flip scams from the same template.  Here's some of them so you can see for yourself:

This is a pretty good quality jigsaw puzzle game at a low price, but there are only five puzzles which is less than some of my other games. A couple of the pictures are really attractive. There are features like allowing you to separate the edge pieces from the other pieces.[quote][url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asset_flip]Warning: Asset Flip![/url][/quote]

Take a look... these are all [i]exactly the same game![/i]

"Jigsaw" is just a free Github jigsaw template for Unity mobile apps, and doesn't have any merit as a proper, fully fledged PC game, so this lame copy of that template is impossible to recommend.

Asset flips don't involve any professional game development.  All Rosa Special Studio does here is change the puzzle images and then dump the exact same game with different images onto Steam as a cash grab.  Asset flips like this are harmful to the gaming industry and to Steam because they reduce the visibility that sincerely made indie games should have, and make it harder for gamers to find real games from genuine developers.

Don't reward this morally bankrupt, unethical behaviour from Rosa Special Studio/Unreal Quality Games.
This is a pretty good quality jigsaw puzzle game at a low price, but there are only five puzzles which is less than some of my other games. A couple of the pictures are really attractive. There are features like allowing you to separate the edge pieces from the other pieces.[quote][url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asset_flip]Warning: Asset Flip![/url][/quote]

Pichi Girl is an asset flip, what Valve calls a "fake game".  The "developer", Rosa Special Studio/Unreal Quality Games, took the [url=https://github.com/Shit-Just-Got-Real-Studios/Jigsaw]Jigsaw[/url] Unity game template/demo from the real developers, Sh*t-Just-Got-Real Studios, changed the name and added a couple (about 3) stock/low effort images of "anime girls", and dumped the result onto Steam.  They're attempting to scam people into buying this, so they can get your money for someone else's work.

It gets worse... the Jigsaw Github template has been shamelessly dumped on Steam by Rosa Special Studio a whopping 64 times.  That's got to be a world record for the most asset flip scams from the same template.  Here's some of them so you can see for yourself:

The atmosphere is great, it has great jump scares, good mechanics and a good inventory system. Enemies will clip through doors sometimes but they're easy to run from and lose interest after you get a certain distance away. I would definitely recommend this game for anyone that loves horror games and can't wait to get back to it tomorrow.

<GameName>Prehistoric World: A New Beginning</GameName>
<CONTENT>
Prehistoric World: A New Beginning is a strategy game set in an open world. As a representative of a private company, you have been given the task of building a complete, functional dinosaur fauna on a newly discovered planet while maximizing your company's profits. You have more than 42 species of dinosaurs to choose from - herbivores, predators, pterosaurs, aquatic dinosaurs.  You have access to many locations on the planet where you can try to revive the Jurassic era. <br><br>You can organize expeditions and hunts for profit, or you can solve situations by landing on the planet yourself. Technology also allows you to control the brain of any dinosaur you have on the planet. You can also breed dinosaurs, sell their eggs, and perform a variety of tasks. There is also a native alien fauna on the planet that you must suppress.<br><br><br><br><strong>STORY</strong><br>66 million years ago, a 15-kilometre asteroid, Chicxulub, crashed into Earth.  The impact of the trillion-ton meteorite was enormously powerful and caused a worldwide ecological disaster. This catastrophe caused the last known mass extinction at the turn of the Mesozoic Era and ended the dominance of the dinosaurs. The impact created a crater 80 kilometres wide and 30 kilometres deep. The impact released enormous energy, resulting in fires, earthquakes and megatsunamis. The worst effects of the impact lasted 30 years. The impact winter that followed the impact lasted more than a century. The entire planet was affected. The disaster wiped out 75 percent of life on Earth.<br><br>By 2190, scientists had deciphered the dinosaurs' DNA and learned to reconstruct it. In 2220, the technology of traveling at the speed of light was discovered and successfully tested.  The exploration and settlement of planets beyond our solar system began.<br><br>In 2362, a private company, ACTAS, found a planet that is 85% similar to our earth from 66 million years ago. The planet was named Hope. The company decided to reconstruct the dinosaur fauna and use it for commercial purposes. The entire planet was declared a protected reserve. Only paying visitors are allowed on the planet. Some private companies have not recognised this move by ACTAS. The company expects huge profits from this unique attraction.<br><br>The first step was to build a space station in the orbit of Hope. Samples of several dozen dinosaurs were brought to the station. The entire planet has been fairly well mapped. Locations were selected for dinosaur settlement where there is less of an abundance of alien species inhabiting the planet. The company has appointed you director of the planetary colonization project. Your task is to build a functional and harmonious fauna on the planet and maximize the company's profits. And here begins your new adventure!

Have not completed entire game, but I am trying to make sure I find all the coins on each level before continuing on.  Levels grow in difficulty and length.  With the programmable robot having a slight difference in each run, your programming decisions become more and more important for the first several lines of codes as those make a huge change by the end of the level.  Not a game I thought I would enjoy, but have found myself playing it all the time when I'm just sitting at the desk.  I really enjoy the way the scenery changes as the levels progress.  Will update as I complete the remaining levels.

<GameName>AOI</GameName>
<CONTENT>
Introduction to the game:<br>AOI is a 2d horizontal board platform jumping game similar to the Galaxy Warrior Demon City. You will play the little girl AOI to explore a fantastic world,<br>AOI wakes up from sleep and loses her memory. As the game goes on, her memory will be gradually awakened and the truth of the world will emerge.<br><br><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2212390/extras/attac.png?t=1669951134" /><br><br>- This is a single player adventure game, requiring players to jump, fight, and a little decryption.<br><br>- The game process of this work has a certain degree of freedom, mainly in the following two aspects:<br>     *The game maps are connected, and players can select the attack sequence of the map area to a certain extent.<br>     *Players can pass through the game in the initial state, or win gold coins by defeating the enemy, and then go to the store to buy powerful weapons, energy stones and other ways to improve themselves, and then challenge the boss. Players can decide according to their own preferences.<br><br>- The game has challenging levels and Boss battles.<br><br>- Players can carry 3 kinds of weapons at the same time. The attack means of each weapon are completely different, and they can switch instantaneously, so that players can achieve their unique fighting style and freely combine their fighting skills.<br><br>- There is almost no mandatory plot animation in the game. Players who only like jumping and fighting can completely ignore the plot. Players who like the plot can also explore the plot of the game through NPC dialogues and scattered information.<br><br>The game supports the key modification of the handle and keyboard, and has made the corresponding UI prompt adaptation. Players can set according to their own habits. Players can simply use ordinary attack clearance games. You can also choose to match different weapons to achieve the combination of skills, or grasp the opportunity to fight with the enemy to make yourself invincible. In short, the game design concept is to give players enough freedom to choose their own way to experience this wonderful journey.

<GameName>Full Gear</GameName>
<CONTENT>
<i>Songs of steam and bright machines...</i><br><br><strong>Welcome to Full Gear! </strong>This steampunk-style traditional roguelike is all about information: learn new things, die from an unknown attack, repeat. Use goggles, guns and gadgets to get a gain on the gears, and find... whatever you're looking for down there. You keep forgetting your goal, don't you Devi? Eyes on the prize!<br>With more than 200 unique items to equip, throw, shoot, learn and lose, there's plenty of possibilities to crash your wrench into the drones patrolling the area. And sometimes your own drones as well. Featuring:<br><ul class="bb_ul"><li>8 sprawling areas, all in one giant room, to traverse</li><li>48 unique enemies, completely animated in cute pixel art style</li><li>6 NPC's with their own hopes, dreams, aspirations, and make-shift shops</li><li>9 Boosts and 9 Challenges to make the game harder - or easier - at will</li><li>6 main bosses and 1 final boss</li><li>28 Steam achievements!</li></ul><h2 class="bb_tag">Make Your Own Death Machines</h2>Ah, but using a weapon is never quite enough, is it? You need additional firepower! Gather Parts and combine them in any way you like using local Drone Stations, then let the crafted <strong>Drones </strong>roam near you, distracting and eliminating any threat. You can make a killer robot with three flamethrowers moving at lightning speed - or a cute companion with a taser called Randy. Nobody's safe from Randy. <br><br><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2212500/extras/gif4.gif?t=1669725842" /><h2 class="bb_tag">A Turn Of Events</h2>That cogwheel of yours isn't just for decoration, it's your essence. Whenever a <strong>Token </strong>reaches the top, it'll activate whatever it does - heal you, shield you, give a Crit, give Scrap, or allow a Drone to fire. Re-arrange these Wheel Tokens to whatever you see fit, and before you can say &quot;hey watch this&quot; you deal 40 damage in one attack.<br>Not enough slots for your tokens to fit? No big deal! Swap <strong>cogwheels </strong>to get more slots, stacked slots, special tokens or more regeneration to increase your active capacity. But beware - larger cogwheels may have more slots, but consequently, each slot activate less often.<br><br><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2212500/extras/gif1A.gif?t=1669725842" /><h2 class="bb_tag">Block And Unlock</h2>Many items are locked at first, but in-game <strong>Goals </strong>can be tracked to unlock them. How do you get 5 Curse? Deal 30 damage? Use a Reclaimer? The items you gain from completing goals interact with those mechanics heavily! Additionally, you can simply choose Traditional Mode, where all items are unlocked from the start and Goals are purely cosmetic. Excellent for those living the rogue-life.<br><br><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2212500/extras/gif2A.gif?t=1669725842" /><h2 class="bb_tag">Remembered History</h2>You aren't alone. Maybe that's for the best.<br><br><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2212500/extras/gif3.gif?t=1669725842" /><br><br>There's people down here. Actual people, Devi. Maybe they have some information. You'll need every bit of it.<br>They have stories to tell? About mechanics? Good. About the lore? Hm, is that interesting?<br>Are they of use? They clearly have things they can give you. Maybe it's worth your time after all.<br><br>Getting them out of this place?<br>What, are you insane?<br><br><strong><i>See you around.</i></strong>

The Last Werewolf is a 2.5D supernatural mystery where you play as Lachie, a twenty-something lone werewolf, in search of more like her. As she looks for them, she investigates supernatural cases to get her one step closer to her heritage. <br><br>In this narrative-driven game, you will be able to chat with the people in the town, follow the clues, and fill out your journal along the way. Your decisions will impact the outcome of your case. If you rely on your Wolf Sense too much, or get grumpy with people, you'll shift into your wolf form, causing gossip in the town, and leaving the original case to go cold.<br><br>Inspiration for this narrative was taken from my first project which was a VR project for a University Master's degree.<br><br>This game will be in Early Access for about a year, with each case being released in stages.

<GameName>Barbelé</GameName>
<CONTENT>
Barbelé is an Action and 3D Fighting, 3rd person game. It's a story driven adventure in a french prison which offers players dialogue choices.<br />
You will have to do your time in prison, survive in a penitentiary with a real in game timer that you can influence with your action. You can make it pass quicker if you can smuggle things like a phone or books in your cell, or you can even add more time if you get caught fighting or doing anything else illegal.<br />
<br />
Barbelé was born under the name “GS project” for “sacrificed generation”. This idea that young immigrants from the projects go through the same thing over and over again. Like a cycle that does not allow you to move forward. Barbelé wants to be an analysis of society, of the police, of justice, of young people in the projects.<br />
The main feature of Barbelé is combat. The goal of the game is to get out of jail. After being sentenced to 2 years in prison, the player will have to try to survive to get out. A system of &quot;timer&quot; present in the game makes it possible to &quot;do your time&quot; to arrive at the moment when you become free. With each fight that you will make in front of witnesses of the penitentiary administration, you will add time to your sentence, you can even be sent to the &quot;hole&quot; for a given time so that you reflect on your actions.<br />
Several ways will be accessible to &quot;do your time&quot; and finally get out of prison. Not making waves and letting yourself be eaten by ill-intentioned prisoners can get you out sooner with reduced sentences or with your feet first... Fighting intelligently will offer you some advantages without risking increasing your time, and on the other hand, constantly fighting will help to establish your position in the prison, make money and easily get a phone in your cell to prepare for the rest of your incarceration. But this can get you into serious trouble, additional penalties that will constantly delay your exit.<br />
The use of the cell phone will be a major component of the game and there too, it will be necessary to learn to identify the guards' rounds and the schedules to know when it is possible to use the phone without risking being caught, which will result in an additional time, the loss of the phone which is very difficult to recover, and a passage to the hole.<br />
There are other ways to get out of jail...

<GameName>Bounty</GameName>
<CONTENT>
A student project made in Unreal Engine 4 at SAE Expression College. A demo level from our game Bounty.<br />
<br />
Bounty is a first-person shooter bounty-hunting game. The player lands on a space station overrun with robotic bounty hunters. The player must locate and kill the bounty. The player is equipped with a six-shooter that shoots explosive rounds. The player fights through the robot bounty hunters to claim the ultimate prize, his reward. The game is a tactical first-person game. The robots are just as deadly as the six shooters the character wields. The player uses a cover system to avoid being shot. The cover system allows the player to return fire in a deadly firefight a little more safely. The game's plot is to create a mix of wild west gunslingers in a future period. The story behind this bounty hunter is that his father owes money to an intergalactic crime syndicate. This bounty is the “last” job for the crime family before he can free his father from his debt or so he thinks. 7 user reviewsReminds me of Dead Space, the cover system is a really cool idea, makes me think, what if Gears of War could move the cover the way Portal does? A quick and easy play that feels tense the first time through.Cool vibe and fun game, gave me a bit of survival horror vibes tbh. It perhaps could've used more of a tutorial because it took me a bit to really "get" what the mechanics were like, for example at the beginning if the game told you how to crouch that would've been nice. Also, a boss fight near the end might have made it cooler. 

But all in all. This is a great prototype and I can't wait to see level two.This game for a collage project is good one problem I had is that there is no HUD in game i died one time because I didn't know how much health i had lost at the moment then i had to restart at the at the beginning overall good job keep up the good work.Walking is too slow, running is too fast, and everything just feels stiff. The devs seem proud of their dynamic cover system, but I never had to use it because bots can't shoot through railings.pros: Interesting atmosphere, well developed, nice particle effects
cons: needs skip-able cut-scenes, needs a story line to captivate players or something to have them return if a full game is being made, needs direction on how to use cover system, tried reloading but couldn't.

keep up the good work!Pleasantly surprised. Moody space shooter with a pounding soundtrack. Both the visuals and music design create a really strong sense of atmospheric tension, excited to see more!Reminds me of Dead Space, the cover system is a really cool idea, makes me think, what if Gears of War could move the cover the way Portal does?

The once splintered tribes are now gathering for a racing competition of epic proportions, the Monster Racing League.

Races are short, hectic, sometimes reckless, but always fun!<br />
<br />
Choose your monster driver from any of the four tribes; Fire, Mountain, River or Sky.<br />
Equip your abilities and boosters at the start of each race. Let your monster do the driving while you strategically play your offensive and defensive abilities.<br />
Standard races are multi-round tournaments with six or more players. The monster with the most points after all rounds wins!

Why? Not the game, although my thoughts have not changed, and about 4 hours is about all the "playing" there is.
It is because the dev has a very similar game, also at a cost that, is in the same state. If they had one game and were working on it? Sure, pay to get it. But this seems like a copy/paste cash grab, which is super sad, since the bones are there..

EDIT2: The devs response did not shine any light on why they released 2 games that are 20% complete, at the same time. My recommendation stays the same. Are you committed to making a good game, or making 2 games that are not really finished and make 2x as much cash? Pretty clear which the devs chose.

This is super beta material. The instructions (in English at least) are not that helpful and only 1 page saying not a lot.
Lots of stuff is not obvious, like only one of the "team" fights at once.
There is no scroll bar on the left, so it is VERY possible you will not notice there are more things to build (looking at you, Uranium!)
I would say I am half way through, and it has got to the point of my income being well high enough to just get each element, spam the buildings, get the next and repeat. Some balancing required.
There is very little in the way of decisions to make. Just make all the things until you need something (has happened twice in 4 hours...), go swap something over and you are done.

So why am I recommending it? Has good bones, I have enjoyed the 4 hours I have into it, and will probably "finish" it in another 4 or so. Tomorrow. :DGood idea for the game but the game is about 20% finished now. There are a lot of different resources but only few of them have specialized machinery, the rest are just copy-paste. Balance is non-existent, some things don't make sense. Why positive review then? Because I enjoyed playing it for 5 hours until it became obvious that it is not finished yet. So if you want to try it for few hours without expecting a full game, I recommend it.

I am not sure if it will be ever finished as their other game - Mining Copper was released two weeks before this one and also has reviews that say it is unfinished (I didn't play it myself) and instead of finishing one game dev released another.

So what is this game about? There are three parts in it: mining, making and exploration.

Mining:
You have several resources and each one has a machinery chain which basically starts from drilling holes, transforming them into tunnels, digging resources, transporting them, processing them into final product (either green/blue energy or just some resource which you store to use in other chains). Each stage in chain produces next resource and can also produce gold. You use gold to upgrade speed and yield of each stage. Some chains don't make sense, for example, you load impure coal into truck making truckload of coal, then unload truckload of coal into more impure coal at warehouse basically making impure coal out of nothing.

Making:
You use green energy to create 5 types of units. Each unit has rank and level. You produce rank 1 units. You can upgrade their level with gold and you can combine two of the same rank into one of the higher rank of the same type. So to create rank 9 unit you need to make 256 rank 1 units. After rank 9 it requires 4 units of the previous rank to make another, so 1024 rank 1 for rank 10, 4096 for rank 11, etc. After you upgrade a unit to a new level with cash you need to craft enough units to at least get it to the same rank before you can use it, luckily if you combine few units, one of which has higher level resulting level will be the highest of them.

Exploration:
You choose 3 unit types and the first unit of those types (usually the strongest unless you reordered them) goes into battle. Each level initially has 10 enemies, one of which is the boss (which increases by 20 each 5 levels). Rightmost unit attacks the enemy, then central unit attacks the enemy, leftmost unit attacks the enemy, and then finally enemy attacks your rightmost unit, so use tanky unit at the rightmost position. If enemy level is higher than your total level of three units then enemy attacks first otherwise you can just kill them before they get a move if your units are strong enough. You get sources of resources as a reward for exploration which are used to produce initial resource in Mining production chains. The further you get the more rare resource sources you find but because there is nothing special about those resources it is still better to just produce initial resources to convert them to green energy and gold. Yes you get more chains but because they cost more to upgrade they end up slower so increase is not very noticable.

And so that's it. Mine resources, produce green energy and gold, spend gold on upgrades, spend energy on crafting new units, combine units, fight.

This cowboy doesn't have legs so he uses his grappling whip to grapple from A to B. When the whip is attached to a grapple point the player will be pulled towards it. Collect all the gems in a level to progress while swinging. Move the crosshair over a grapple point to attach the whip and move forward. Different kinds of grapple points are scattered around the levels and can act differently based on their color. <br />
<br />
Some of the grapple points move to another place so the player can use them as transport and others give the player more velocity to reach more places. Sometimes it can be beneficial to detach from a point at the right moment to reach a gem or a new point. Watch out for rotating and moving spikes and dropping down in the abyss will make you start over but don’t worry you won’t have to collect all your gems again.<br />

 The story was intriguing and made me think a lot about my own personal struggles with life and thoughts of suicide. 

I was truly enjoying my time with this game until i got about an hour in and couldn't progress. There was a page with a youtube link that i could not decipher despite trying for a good fifteen minutes or so. Disappointing as i was looking forward to seeing how the game would end. 

Overall 6/10

<GameName>Scrapbox</GameName>
<CONTENT>
<strong>HEY! This game is still a work in progress, and a LOT is being changed. Stick around for more info!</strong><br><br>Scrapbox is a frantic 2.5D fighter where a bunch of strange specimen beat each other up for little to no reason.<h2 class="bb_tag">ACCESSIBILITY FIRST</h2>Scrapbox was made with casual <i>and </i>competitive play in mind as opposed to leaning super heavily in either direction. The game has very easy inputs consisting of a direction, a button press, and your character's position (in air or grounded) instead of super difficult inputs that take 7.346 trillion years to learn. To make up for the game being easy to control, each character has a boat load of attacks - 8 Light Moves, 8 Mid Moves, 8 Strong Moves, 8 Special Moves and 3 Ultra Moves.<h2 class="bb_tag">SOME TECH, YES</h2>This game has a few ways to cancel moves. There's jump cancelling, which affects everything but Ultras, which is performed by inputting a jump during a small window as you attack. Land cancelling exists too - landing during an aerial cancels it immediately. On top of that, you can air dash in 4 directions, wave dash, dodge roll, and much more!<h2 class="bb_tag">ACHIEVEMENTS GALORE</h2>There are multiple achievements to snag for doing the most bizarre things possible. Every update brings new ones!<h2 class="bb_tag">MODES</h2>Just in case regular fighting gets old, there are a handful of other modes for you to enjoy!<br><br><ul class="bb_ul"><li><strong>TRAINING MODE</strong> lets you, well, train. You can see every character's hitboxes, speed up or slow the game down and more to let you lab with your favourite character!<br></li><li><strong>CAMEO KICKER</strong> has you punting tons of flying discs imprinted with characters that didn't quite make the cut. Good old arcade fun!<br></li><li><strong>TOUR MODE</strong> is the game's platform fighter hybrid, with huge stages and plenty of enemies to smack. Speed through the level or take your time battering each enemy one by one!<br></li><li><strong>CHAOS MODE</strong> throws balancing out the window and randomises every character's attributes. Good luck, have fun!<br></li><li><strong>TAG TEAM MODE</strong> lets you choose up to three different fighters and tag them in and out mid-match. If all three get KO'd, you're out!<br></li><li><strong>STORY MODE</strong> tells the most bizarre story ever seen in a fighting game. 'Nuff said.</li></ul>

<GameName>Polaris Outpost</GameName>
<CONTENT>
You find yourself alone on a remote research outpost in the Polaris system. Something has gone terribly wrong. Much of the base is lacking power and your co-workers are mysteriously missing. There is a deadly threat lurking in this outpost and it will take all of your cunning to keep from becoming another victim.<br><br>Your resources are dwindling, so you'll need to secure more food, water, and power, but this involves venturing away from the security of your home base. Equipped with various items to track, deter, and trick your adversary, there is a chance you can outwit your opponent. However, you'll need to keep a close eye on your stats, as it's all too easy to get dehydrated or lose your sanity to the extreme stress of these circumstances.<br><br>You will need to explore deep into your opponent's territory to find a way to escape this outpost. A distress signal may take too long, so maybe you can get the escape shuttle up and running instead. Or maybe there is a way to actually defeat this adversary. One thing is for certain, this won't be easy. Your adversary is becoming more intelligent by the minute, and it is adapting to resist your weapons. You'll need to move quickly and find more powerful equipment if you expect to stand a chance. Can you survive Polaris Outpost?<br><br><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2209080/extras/Vertical_No_text.png?t=1668453444" /><br><br>Polaris Outpost is a blend of survival, horror, and minimalist base building. It involves both planning ahead and thinking on your feet in order to survive. You will be up against a single powerful adversary that evolves to become stronger and more intelligent throughout the game. You will secure resource production rooms and find ways to defend or repair them. The gameplay is often tense and frightening as you try to out maneuver and outsmart your deadly opponent in a variety of atmospheric sci-fi environments. The game becomes progressively more open-ended, giving you more of a chance to make your own decisions.

Farm crops, tame alien beasts, incorporate salvaged technology and fortify your home against hostile intruders<br><br><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2209140/extras/Construction_-_Resized.gif?t=1669149424" /><h2 class="bb_tag">ENGAGE IN DEEP TACTICAL COMBAT</h2>Prevailing in combat will require more than just point-and-click. A detailed hit simulation and health system will mean that even non-lethal hits can render a survivor unable to go on. Suppressive fire might pin an enemy in place, but the ammunition used up may leave you ill-equipped to fight the next encounter effectively<br><br><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2209140/extras/Explosion_-_Resized.gif?t=1669149424" /><h2 class="bb_tag">DRIVE RESTORED VEHICLES</h2>It's a big world out there. To get around you will need better transportation than your legs can provide. One of the things setting Ascent of Ashes apart from other games of this genre is the ability to restore and drive vehicles.<br><br><br><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2209140/extras/Vehicles_-_Resized.gif?t=1669149424" /><h2 class="bb_tag">LEAD YOUR SURVIVORS</h2>Each survivor has their own unique personality and motivations. As colony leader it is up to you to find and recruit capable survivors to fill gaps in your roster against ever increasing challenges. Can you keep everyone happy, secure and motivated?<br><br><br><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2209140/extras/Campfire_-_Resized.gif?t=1669149424" /><h2 class="bb_tag">EXPLORE A STRANGE NEW WORLD</h2>You will find yourself in an expansive, procedurally generated world filled with different biomes and points of interest. To survive the post-apocalypse you'll have to brave the pre-collapse ruins and the many dangers that they hold.<br><br><br><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2209140/extras/Floaters_-_Resized.gif?t=1669149424" /><h2 class="bb_tag">CHALLENGE A DYNAMIC AI</h2>It's not enough to just have an in-depth combat system with a variety of mechanics. You also need opponents capable of using those mechanics to challenge you. Enemies will possess varying degrees of intelligence. Taking on a disorganized band of raiders will play very differently from fighting a squad of well-trained Remnant soldiers.<br><br><br><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2209140/extras/Dynamic_AI_-_Resized.gif?t=1669149424" /><h2 class="bb_tag">FROM THE ORGINAL CREATORS OF COMBAT EXTENDED</h2>Combining the deep simulation of classic post-apocalyptical survival titles with the tactical challenge of classic real time and turn-based gems, the original creators of RimWorld's heralded <strong>Combat Extended</strong> mod present a fresh take on the colony sim genre that emphasizes exploration, tight balance and strategic gameplay.<h2 class="bb_tag">MODDING SUPPORT</h2>Our team has its roots in mod-making and we've been fortunate to have been part of many great modding communities over the years. That's why with Ascent of Ashes, we want to give something back to those communities. We're building the game's engine from the ground up to be easily extendable, and thanks to our extensive experience in creating mods ourselves we know exactly what kind of support mod-makers need. Ascent of Ashes is a game developed by modders, for modders.

Bebop will meet people that will shape his personality, he will go after those who wronged him, and he will, in the end, reach the end of his story. OR IS HE?<br />

I wanted to create an experience that genuinely surprises the player and makes them feel like they never truly know what's going to happen next. From day one, I've always wanted the world to feel alive and story-wise it needs to. The world you exist in is not one based in reality and is carefully crafted to the player's actions in the game. The way you play changes the world around you, and I thought this was a really concept to explore.

Victoria the Vampire ascends the Vampiric Tower once more!<br><br>A brand-new game featuring rooms from both Vampiric Tower 1 &amp; 2, as well as plenty of new ones. Plus, it has all new graphics and music! And it's much easier than 2!<br><br>For the uninitiated, Vampiric Tower is a box-pushing puzzle game. The original game was made way back in 2000, when I was 16. Vampiric Tower Remix is the best &amp; definitive entry of the series!<br><br>Push the boxes around to block the spells from the Pumpkins and the Ghosts. Try to pick up all the vials in each room without getting zapped, and then get to the exit! If you do get zapped, do not fret! You have unlimited lives in this game, so just try again!<br><br>Turn into a bat to fly over spikes, water, pots, and other stuff in your way! Cast ice spells to turn the denizens of the tower into ice cubes that you can push around! Rock out to amazing chiptune remixes of Mozart classics!<br><br>Featuring 15 worlds with 8 rooms each, for 120 rooms total. The 15 worlds are divided into 5 episodes of 3 worlds each. The worlds in each episode can be tackled in any order.<br><br>Let’s check out those worlds!<br><br><ul class="bb_ul"><li><strong>The Old Tower</strong>: Featuring classics from the original game! Get re-acquainted with the Pumpkins and Ghosts!<br></li><li><strong>Jiangshi Junction</strong>: The Jiangshis hop around and stop in place if they touch Victoria.<br></li><li><strong>Faerie Gardens</strong>: Faeries move back and forth to block Victoria’s progress. Nothing a well-placed ice spell can’t fix!<br></li><li><strong>Magick Library</strong>: Say hello to the Witches! They are intently reading their books, but when the last vial is collected, look out!<br></li><li><strong>Tomb of the Sun</strong>: The Mummies can be frozen, but they’ll fall apart afterward. Since you can only freeze them once, make it count!<br></li><li><strong>Bodacious Botany</strong>: These alien plants from Venus just won’t stop re-growing!<br></li><li><strong>Medusa’s Lair</strong>: Like the Witches, the Snakes wake up when all vials are collected. Their fireballs move pretty fast!<br></li><li><strong>Atlantean Shrine</strong>: The Shades cast ice spells, just like Victoria!<br></li><li><strong>Lil’ Bot Factory</strong>: The industrious Lil’ Bots walk back and forth, pushing boxes, pots, flasks, or anything else they find.<br></li><li><strong>Ethereal Palace</strong>: Imps like to bop back and forth and get in the way. Silly Imps!<br></li><li><strong>World Tree Roots</strong>: The Sorceresses have mastered a spell that can travel through pillars and pots, just like the Pumpkins and Ghosts! Luckily, it moves much slower than theirs.<br></li><li><strong>The Pearly Gates</strong>: The Doubles are perfect copies of Victoria. Whatever she does, they follow!<br></li><li><strong>Awesome Alchemy</strong>: Wisps move about and disintegrate when they touch Victoria. They have no resolve!<br></li><li><strong>All Hail Mars</strong>: The formidable Knights are invincible and immune to all magic.<br></li><li><strong>The Grand Finale</strong>: Put your skills to the test in the final world!</li></ul><br>Can Victoria make it through the 120 rooms of this new tower?

Literally like 10 people knew this game existed, and I was one of them.

A huge thank you to Dreams Interactive and Strategy First for giving this game a chance to to be discovered again, it's an amazing little hidden gem that's just as addictively fun to play as it was when I played it as a kid. Though relatively simple nowadays, this very grungy cyberpunk/industrial Wipeout clone captivated me growing up.

My only complaint is that they seem to have not implemented the music for the game, possibly due to licensing issues (though the music label still appears on billboards in game and the music track selector still has the names of the songs). Growing up, I know that the game wouldn't play the music unless you had the CD in the drive, but you could still play the game without the music if you didn't have the disc. It could be that they just didn't implement the features that were on disc. If you want, go ahead and buy this version, but if you can find a copy on disc, get that too so you can experience the game with the music as originally intended by the original developers.I never imagined for the life of me that one of my favorite little bargain bin games growing up would ever make it on Steam.

Ansoku is a relaxing, fun, simple, and yet challenging puzzle game with a high replay value. <br />
<br />
The concept of the game is simple, use the given blocks to create rows, once a row is created it will be cleared and you receive the sum of its points and charge your rotate points. If however, you can no longer place any of the blocks you are given, the game will be over. <br />
<br />
Now also available on desktop, its main intent is to be a game that can be played when you just want to relax. It can run in its own smaller window so you can do things on the side if you wish. No time pressure, play at your own pace and you can stop the game at any time to return where you left off later.<br />
<br />
Play smart and grow your high score!<br />
<br />
But most importantly, have fun :)

<i>Broadside thunder,<br>steel plate sundered,<br>munitions ablaze,<br>once triumphant -<br>sinking to a watery grave,<br>Ruler of the Waves.<br>- Inscriptus</i><br><br><br>Man the turrets of mighty Dreadnought battleships and battlecruisers and blow your enemy out of the water to secure your position as... the Ruler of the Waves!<br><br>Ruler of the Waves 1916 is a naval combat game and turret-based shooter. The main gameplay involves aiming and firing the turrets. Since turrets take 30 seconds to reload, the player must utilize multiple turrets on multiple ships to maximize their firepower. Things are made more difficult due to the movement of the ships and the sea, and consistent accuracy will be a challenge to all but the most experienced gunner. Sink all the enemy boats to achieve victory - with bonus points earned for quickness.<br><br>The game follows, in a fictional sense, the major battlecruiser engagements in WWI such as the Battles of Heligoland Bight and Jutland, which would be the last time ships of this kind reigned supreme before improvements to high-flying aircraft and deep-diving submarines made them all but obsolete. <br><br>Dreadnought-era battleships and battlecruisers are similar in size and firepower, but differ in terms of armor thickness, turret layout, and speed. Battleships are more heavily armored, whereas battlecruisers have the advantage in mobility. <br><br>The player will have an opportunity to board both types of ship and unleash mighty salvos upon the opposing fleet.

Help Mr. Ball have a safe and comfortable trip 1 user reviewsI appreciate it's smooth controls. The game is just as described, every jump requires precision and patience for the right moments. I'm glad I wasn't able to save on my own and load the save if I fell, I feel like the challenge of the game would be reduced too much. Having to start from wherever you land is demoralizing, but I found it to be a part of the fun. Something I wasn't aware of at the start is how much your jump is charged, I was able to figure this out by seeing the light beneath Mr. Ball growing brighter.

Masa Gorse 3 user reviewsReview at: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijQvCQ__Df4&t=10s
Well this game is not what I expected. A single small environment where you fight a single monster. No explanation of what the point of the story for this game is. No clear instructions on buttons. The only way to get out of the middle of the game is a hard exit or you die. The monster and you can glitch on invisible walls or rocks.The game is pretty and the monster looks cool but that is where the positives end. 

Firstly, the game is using 100% of my GPU. Performance aside, it is not clear at all what you're supposed to do. You can't even look up the controls in the options. You are just dropped into the forest with no weapon or any idea of how to make one, while the OST of the Witcher 3 if it was composed and performed by a drunkard blares in the background.

It has potential, but it needs some more work.

Edit:
The good news is that I found the weapons, the bad is the combat is just terrible.

<br />
· This is a prison themed role-playing and simulation business game.<br />
· The player assumes the role of a prison guard in charge of a prison.<br />
· The player needs certain strategies to keep the prison running properly and keep the indicators above a certain score.<br />
· Different prisoners have different levels of violence.<br />
· Grow assets as much as possible.<br />
· Increase order as much as possible.<br />
· If you've ever fantasized about being a prison guard and managing prisoners in your own way, don't miss this game! 1 user reviewsBought the game and tried it. I don't understand how the game works, there is no "help" or anything. It just wants you to do random bullshit without telling you what they need to do like feeding them or etc. There's no instruction or anything to help us enjoy the game. Waste of money

Cats will hide in all apartments of a multi-storey building. Search every corner of the room, move the pillows, open the bedside tables, check the toilet.... Cats can hide in the most unpredictable places.<br><br><strong>Key Features:</strong><br>- 5 floors;<br>- 250 cats;<br>- Hints;<br><br>During the development of this game, we were motivated by the game &quot;<i>A Building Full of Cats</i>&quot;. 9 user reviewsNow if you have played [i]A Building Full of Cats[/i] then you'll find this game strangely familiar. There is a thread in which the creator mentions that they did reach out to the other team asking for permission to borrow the concept which is to clear out several floors that are full of cats.

These levels have their own theme, colour and music. There is one scrollable screen on each floor and a bathroom you have to enter. Now, of the two games this appears to be the lesser one (there are no animations when changing floors) but I enjoyed it just the same. Looking for secret cats that require interaction with objects on our part is just pure fun! 

Perhaps it's best to start with this one of the two games so that the experience with [i]A Building Full of Cats[/i] will be a bit more enjoyable.A blatant rip off of another game with basically the same title, and this one is not as good.  All cats found within 30 minutes, and there are no secrets or surprises.  Achievements don't count on your profile.  I'd recommend the other game over this one.   I'm still giving this one a positive, because it's fine for what it is at the sale price of 40% off.In the game you need to find cute cats in different places of the room, all rooms are unique and visually beautiful.Has lovely colors, has lovely music, and the dev fixes bugs immediately. Is it similar to A Building Full of Cats? Indeed it is since the dev was inspired to make this game due to the other game. Listen folks, we can't get enough hidden kitty games so if you enjoy these types of games then pick this one up as wellI found some cats... Shocker.

<GameName>The Search for a Colour Palette</GameName>
<CONTENT>
As you come home from a long journey to see your son once more, you discover he is gone. A castle has been presumably summoned from thin air and it has a dark, gloomy presence to it. With this castle appearing, all the colours also disappeared, leaving everything looking lifeless. You hear a woman's voice in your head, beckoning you toward the castle. After grabbing your ancient shield and trusty boomerang you go towards an adventure that you simply don't know how will end. All you know is that you are going to save your son, no matter what it takes.<br><br><u><i>Gameplay:</i></u><br>The Search for a Colour Palette (TSFACP) has 7 levels in total, each ending with a boss at the end. Inspired by the classic Castlevania games from the 80's, you have to fight your way through monsters, unknown creatures, and beasts in order to get to your final destination: the castle. <br><br>At your disposal you have a boomerang that you can throw and also hover in the air with, knives you can pick up throughout the levels and throw at enemies for additional damage, and a holy shield with which you can block damage and jump on top of enemies. You also gain experience from killing enemies, making you even stronger...be careful not to kill too many though. Use all of these tools to your advantage, because there are some platforming challenges to be had in your adventure!<br><br><u><i>Credits:</i></u><br><strong>SeventyFour Productions</strong> - Programming, graphic design, spritework, cover art, mechanics<br><strong>Bro.

<img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2203610/extras/Follow.gif?t=1669738693" /><br><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2203610/extras/ant.gif?t=1669738693" /><br>Ants of Duty is a strategy game about managing a small colony of ants that find themselves in an unknown territory. You have to help them cope with the huge dangers on their way, such as red ants, wasps and crabs, so that the ants find their way back to their home. Get resources, build an army and defeat enemies.Особенности: a game for the speed of development of the colony, many different opponents, a game with a choice of consequences. PositiveThis is a scam; ignore the positive reviews--they have nothing to do with this 'game' and are completely misleading.  

Where to begin?  The main menu has 2 options:  Play and exit.  No options.  No instructions.  No tutorial.  Once you start the game, its even worse.  No instructions, terrible graphics.  

Gameplay consists of pressing 3 possible buttons (Q, A, and Z) to summon a worker ant (Q) or some fighter ants (the others).  The works automatically (and with about the stupidest AI imaginable) collect a leaf while you 'control' the warrior ants by clicking on them and sending them to attach the enemy 'base' which is always to the right by clicking on it.  No strategy, no depth.  There's one resource (leaves).  You can't build anything except the 3 types of ants.  Can't build any buildings. 

Oh, and usually if you try to select your ants, it takes about a half dozen times before the game registers it.  Imagine a RTS where there's 1 resource, 3 units which have almost nonexistent AI, completely empty levels, asset flip graphics and--somehow--a completely buggy UI that doesn't register your clicks most of the time.  That's 'Ants of Duty'.  Thank goodness for Steam's refund policy.Interesting game where you can feel like a king ant, it's interesting and fun, I advise you this game, there is interesting gameplay, convenient controls, it is not expensive and worth it to try to play, I really liked it

<GameName>Shadow Lens</GameName>
<CONTENT>
Shadow Lens is a found-footage video game set in the 90s. The game was never finished, its release in 2000 was due to developer negligence. I obtained the original code for the game and ported it to PC for you to play. There is a lot of unused content in the game files that can only be accessed with cheats. <br />
<br />
The game case reads:<br />
--------------------------------------------------<br />
Monsters lurk across your uncle's farm.<br />
Collect tools to unlock new areas.<br />
Upgrade your camera to navigate the darkness.<br />
Find your missing daughter.<br />
Discover what happened to her.<br />
Solve puzzles to get items.<br />
Complete quests for the locals.<br />
Get slimed and try again!<br />
--------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
The player is thrust into the role of a nameless protagonist tasked with investigating the strange happenings on an old farm. Discover the mystery of what happened to your daughter, Hantu. On the journey finding a plethora of tools and items to aid in her search. For example, your upgradable polaroid camera can be used to aluminate dark spaces. But be careful, because monsters often hide in these areas and are hard to see. To find Hantu, puzzles involving items must be solved. Most items can be interacted with, consumed, or picked up with your hand. Mastery of the tools and consumables is the key to finding Her. Hidden secrets from Cheat Codes to Unlockable areas litter the landscape. It is up to you to find them. Are you brave enough to look within the shadows and find Hantu?

This game is a Virtual Reality First Person target shooting experience. You go through each environment in your elevator and clear the targets. The faster you clear them, the more points you get. Its THAT simple! 3 user reviewsI just can't recommend this freebie. I don't think it works as an aim trainer because the gun model is so bad and I don't know of a single VR game that this would train you for. The "gun model" doesn't even have iron sights. 

Also, this free to play title needs better optimization. I was getting shaky gameplay on my RTX 3080. I literally felt like I was doing target practice in the middle of an LA earthquake. 

It has a few levels. I did the levels several times before the 5 minutes was up so that I could post a review. I just wanted to quit real quick and never play again. Good luck to the dev, with some polish, this may be a good target practice / aim trainer in the future, but it's not there currently.I just can't recommend this freebie.

The pictures do not do it justice, this game is beautiful, my jaw dropped at one point. It's also very fun, i love exploring and looking in every corner so this game suits me perfectly. What i thought would entertain me for 10 minutes, i ended up playing for an hour and a half and i still haven't found everything. If you like exploring or collecting all the objectives i cannot recommend this enough.

Edit: I kind of missed this in my playthrough but you can take some really beautiful pictures in the game, check out the devs on twitter to see some of the bestNice and relaxing game you can spend time in and just explore and take pictures you like.00111110 00100000 01001111 01100010 01101010 01100101 01100011 01110100 00111010 00100000 01001110 01100101 01101101 00110000 00101101 00110001 00001101 00001010 00111110 00100000 01001111 01100010 01101010 01100101 01100011 01110100 01101001 01110110 01100101 00111010 00100000 01000011 01100001 01110000 01110100 01110101 01110010 01100101 00100000 01101100 01101001 01110110 01101001 01101110 01100111 00100000 01100010 01100101 01101001 01101110 01100111 01110011 00100000 01101001 01101110 00100000 01110100 01101000 01100101 00100000 01100001 01101110 01101111 01101101 01100001 01101100 01101111 01110101 01110011 00100000 01111010 01101111 01101110 01100101 00001101 00001010 00111110 00100000 01010011 01110100 01100001 01110100 01110101 01110011 00111010 00100000 01010010 01110101 01101110 01101110 01101001 01101110 01100111

[*]+ Availability: the game is free
[*]+ Beautiful graphics
[*]+ Professional camera
[*]+ Lots of living creatures to shoot
[*]+ Open world
[*]+ Pleasant nature sounds
[*]+ Unobtrusive soundtrack
[*]+ Simple controls
[*]+ Lots of filters and camera settings
[*]+ In-game encyclopedia
[*]+ To photograph some creatures, you will need endurance and patience

[b]Did not like:[/b]
[*]- Lack of settings
[*]- A small number of frames available for shooting
[*]- A bug at the beginning of the game: when using the prone position for the first time, the character could not stand up again. Until he fell off the cliff.
[*]- At times, when moving through the vines - the character's head begins to spin wildly.[/list]

[b]Conclusion:[/b]
A great little Indie-game in which the player simply has to explore a small map - and take photos of the animals they encounter. The more beautiful and "correct" the photo is taken, the better it will look in the encyclopedia.
An almost real camera is available to the player - in which he can not only use zoom, but also rotate, filters, and adjust the exposure / contrast of the photo. True, during all the manipulations - time does not stand still, therefore, having set the necessary parameters, the player will have to be patient - in order to catch an interesting frame again.
Not all living creatures in the world are harmless - and can sometimes fight back if the player gapes and gets too close. But do not worry - there is no concept of death in the game - after shutdown, the Robot will be restored at the last boot server.
The game is not big, but it's nice to spend time in it - having a rest from the industrial world in the bosom of nature.

<GameName>Hunting Life VR: Dove Season</GameName>
<CONTENT>
<strong><u>NOTE</u></strong>: This game requires a Meta / Oculus VR headset and controllers (Rift S or Quest 2 with Link). <br><br><strong><u>Bag your limit in a one-of-a-kind VR experience!</u></strong><br>From one of the designers of the best-selling Deer Hunter and Bird Hunter series of the past comes a thrilling new hunting game, designed and developed from the beginning to be played in VR! <br><br><br><br><u><strong>The Hunt</strong></u><br>Deep in the immersion of virtual reality, keep your eyes peeled for doves and your shotgun at the ready. But be sure that your target is a dove and not a crow or songbird or you’ll have to pay a fine for breaking the game laws! <br><br>Earn money for each dove that you bag and spend your earnings to buy new guns or “power ups” for a day (such as highlighting downed birds to make them easier to see). Choose your shotgun from a wide assortment of pump-action, semi-auto, side-by-side and over-under (in 12ga, 20ga, and .410). <br><br>Bag rare banded birds and see the location where they were banded and the age of the bird on special certificates in your farmhouse. Can you collect all of the 40+ band locations? Other, even more rare, birds await you in the field as well! <br><br><br><u><strong>Your Hunting Land</strong></u><br>Explore as you hunt your own private 550 acre hunting land. This area is dove heaven, containing sunflower fields, hay fields, wooded thickets and stock tanks. You hunt with a full 24 hour day-night cycle, so you can use your headlamp to get to your hunting spot before sunrise or find that bird that you downed just before shooting hours closed at sunset. <br><br>The realistic dove AI means that you are much more likely to find doves feeding in the early morning and evening, roosting through the midday, and sipping water and picking up some gravel in late mornings and early afternoons. <br><br>Doves can follow different patterns on different days, meaning that spot where you bagged your limit on a previous day may not be nearly as busy the next time you hunt. It is important to know where, and when, feeding and watering areas are…and where the birds roost, as you may kick some birds out of their roost by walking through! <br><br><br><u><strong>Hunt Your Way</strong></u><br>Hunting Life VR: Dove Season allows you customize your hunting experience to be what you want it to be. Do you want a realistic hunting experience with just a few doves that can spot you if you’re not in cover? Go for it! Or maybe you prefer tons of doves with no non-game birds? We’ve got you covered! Want to forget about game laws and just go out and have fun bagging birds with no limits? You can do that too!<br><br><br><u><strong>Action Challenge</strong></u><br>When you’ve gotten comfortable with hunting doves in Dove Season, be sure to try out the Action Challenge where you are set in the path of a never-ending flock of doves and you must down as many as you can before time runs out! Special silver and gold doves are worth more points and they add to your time. Stringing hits together will increase your score multiplier. Action Challenge takes it all: speed, accuracy, target recognition! <br><br>Hunting Life VR lets you enjoy the outdoors your way! <br><br><u><strong>Achievements</strong></u><br>Try to obtain 15 different Steam Achievements, including: <br><ul class="bb_ul"><li><strong>Peas in a Pod</strong> - Down two doves that hit the ground within 3 yards of each other. <br></li><li><strong>Double Trouble</strong> - Down two doves within 2 seconds.<br></li><li><strong>Not a Lost Cause</strong> - Bag 100 doves in a row without losing a single bird.</li></ul><br>Achievements are displayed in-game (per save) in the &quot;farm house&quot;. Some special achievements unlock shotgun skins that can only be obtained through earning the achievement! <br><br><strong><u>Lama glama Game Company</u></strong><br>We are an indie game company and we have roots in the game industry, specifically with hunting games. Lama glama founder, Tom Shiflet, served as producer / game designer on the best selling hunting games from Sunstorm Interactive, including the <strong>Deer Hunter</strong>, <strong>Bird Hunter </strong>and <strong>Rocky Mountain Trophy Hunter</strong> series. Hunting Life VR is returning to our roots as game developers…and combining our passions: enjoying the outdoors and video games!

You can view my initial impressions & gameplay here: https://youtu.be/8WVSDbPqN78

I think Hunting Life VR has a good concept. A semi-realistic hunting setup which has you specifically hunting for doves. While the concept is neat, the execution is not. I find it difficult to say anything else positive about the experience.

The biggest thing (maybe) is that the visuals are poor, but also the game is poorly optimized. The game also has arcade-like gun mechanic that has you holding the shotgun with one hand. The gun mechanics are poor overall & just not realistic, along with the reloading being very finnicky. The game also has poor sounds & ugly UI.

Game is running on the Unity Engine. On my RTX 3080, I was getting variable frame rates from 40 to 90 fps throughout, although I did have all the graphical options set to max. You do have full locomotion, along with smooth or snap turning. The VR interactions are very basic here. You hold the shotgun in one hand, you spawn a shell in the off hand. You press grab to open the shotgun chamber with your off-hand and holding down. I had to try multiple times to reload the shotgun.

Overall, this game is just too expensive given the lack of polish, visuals, sounds, presentation, etc. I cannot recommend it.

<img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2201540/extras/The_Story.png?t=1669718844" /><br>You find yourself in the Australian outback with the bare minimum to survive. You are surrounded by Australian wildlife and most of it is as deadly as it comes. You have no memory of who you are and how you got here. You also find out that people appear to have abandoned this area. <br><br>Surviving in the Australian outback isn't easy - it is an extremely harsh environment with extreme temperatures, low rainfall, and little vegetation. The water is scarce. You will have to find your own strategy to survive, manage the heat and gather food. <br><br>Who are you and how did you get here?<br><br>Why are you alone?<br><br>Why did people leave this place?<br><br>How do you get back to civilisation?<br><br>And finally, are you really alone...<br><br><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2201540/extras/Survival.png?t=1669718844" /><br>Australian wildlife isn't the friendliest in the world. Kangaroos and dingoes can be aggressive, but saltwater crocodiles or the eastern brown snake will most likely cause your death if you get too close to them. <br><br>You will have to develop your own strategy to survive. You can either approach them directly with a weapon you crafted earlier, or you can build traps and prepare poisoned baits. <br><br>However, wildlife isn't your biggest problem. Extreme temperatures and dehydration is what usually kills people stranded in the Australian outback. You must find water. You must find shade. You may consider sleeping through the heat of the day and explore the outback at a night time. Or you can gather as much water as you can and continue exploring. You may carefully plan the trip so you stay shaded for most of it. The choice is entirely up to you. <br><br><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2201540/extras/SnakeTrap.gif?t=1669718844" /><br><br><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2201540/extras/BuildAndCraft.png?t=1669718844" /><br>Building system allows players to build the shelter as advanced or as simple as they want.

<GameName>Rocket Escape</GameName>
<CONTENT>
Rocket Escape is an innovative 2D platformer about rocket jumping your way to the goal. Despite being around in gaming for a long time, rocket jumping is usually relegated to a side mechanic. However, we believed that rocket jumping could be so much more. Featuring mechanics such as slow motion/rocket time, speedrunning timers, black hole rockets, and more, Rocket Escape is an expansion on the time-tested concept of rocket jumping. We at Compact Square Studios have been working on Rocket Escape as a passion project over the last few years, and we are excited to be able to release the game on Steam and share it with the world.<br><br>We look forward to seeing how you approach and enjoy the game!<br><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2201680/extras/pickuplaunchersmol.png?t=1670204722" /> 6 user reviewsRocket Escape is a game that takes a lot from Portal.
It's short, it's fun, and it's not something that's really been done before.
For just a few bucks, I'd say it's a great buy.From its inception in 2020 to release in 2022 Rocket Escape has been a labor of love from the burgeoning studio Compact Square. With its simplistic yet detailed art style and portal-esque puzzle levels, Rocket Escape leaves the player not only wanting to finish the game, but also to reach perfection with its level clock. The easy mode makes the game accessible for those less game inclined. The level editor is sure to bring us a ton of fun for a long time to come. Thank you CS studios for such an amazing experience!Rocket Escape is a game that takes a lot from Portal.

<GameName>IN CELL</GameName>
<CONTENT>
IN CELL is a kinetic visual novel (linear, no choices) about the epidemic of sexless, nationless, and friendless men.  Gender dynamics are currently not functional, sustainable, or beneficial to either men or women.  IN CELL is an uncensored conversation between the sexes.  Not that such a conversation will solve anything.<br />
<br />
There are no specific characters, just mostly nameless men, and women.  It is better to think of men and women as the characters rather than specific people.  There are themes of racism, violence, sex, porn, and pretty much anything you could think of that may bother you.  There's a healthy dose of memes too as the subject matter necessitates it.<br />
<br />
You'll enjoy the hot new dating app &quot;Let's **** Chad!&quot;  You'll consider violence a reasonable solution.  You'll hate, you'll love, and you'll be numb.  IN CELL while primarily written by me does include direct quotes of men from youtube, 4chan, reddit, and other corners of the internet.<br />
<br />
IN CELL does not come from a place of wanting to solve the problem.  It is merely a talking point in the form of a visual novel.  I wanted to write about the modern male experience.  I was inspired by innumerable sources that I won't name as they may not want to be associated with this work.  I've read books, watched hundreds of thousands of hours of youtube videos, browsed forums, and have gone outside.<br />
<br />
I, like many other men, do not like this world.  IN CELL is about our experience as men.

To roll to the designated panel, you need to make sure that the eyes on the panel are the same as the eyes on your top, but you change the eyes every time you roll. So, even if you roll honestly, it may not work. When that happens, I recommend that you start over, choose a different puzzle, or get away from &quot;Suikoro&quot; and play another game, or go outside and change your mind.<br><br><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2214480/extras/explanation_image_2.png?t=1668567575" /><br><br>■Change your colors and change your mood!<br>Are your colors white, black and red?

Tsubaki Hata is an asset flip, what Valve calls a "fake game".  The "developer", Unreal Quality Games/Rosa Special Studio, took the [url=https://github.com/Shit-Just-Got-Real-Studios/Jigsaw]Jigsaw[/url] Unity game template/demo from the real developers, Sh*t-Just-Got-Real Studios, changed the name and added a couple (about 3) stock/low effort images of "anime girls", and dumped the result onto Steam.  They're attempting to scam people into buying this, so they can get your money for someone else's work.

It gets worse... the Jigsaw Github template has been shamelessly dumped on Steam by Rosa Special Studio a whopping 64 times.  That's got to be a world record for the most asset flip scams from the same template.  Here's some of them so you can see for yourself:

Take a look... these are all [i]exactly the same game![/i]

"Jigsaw" is just a free Github jigsaw template for Unity mobile apps, and doesn't have any merit as a proper, fully fledged PC game, so this lame copy of that template is impossible to recommend.

Asset flips don't involve any professional game development.  All Rosa Special Studio does here is change the puzzle images and then dump the exact same game with different images onto Steam as a cash grab.  Asset flips like this are harmful to the gaming industry and to Steam because they reduce the visibility that sincerely made indie games should have, and make it harder for gamers to find real games from genuine developers.

Don't reward this morally bankrupt, unethical behaviour from Unreal Quality Games/Rosa Special Studio.
[quote][url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asset_flip]Warning: Asset Flip![/url][/quote]

Tsubaki Hata is an asset flip, what Valve calls a "fake game".  The "developer", Unreal Quality Games/Rosa Special Studio, took the [url=https://github.com/Shit-Just-Got-Real-Studios/Jigsaw]Jigsaw[/url] Unity game template/demo from the real developers, Sh*t-Just-Got-Real Studios, changed the name and added a couple (about 3) stock/low effort images of "anime girls", and dumped the result onto Steam.  They're attempting to scam people into buying this, so they can get your money for someone else's work.

It gets worse... the Jigsaw Github template has been shamelessly dumped on Steam by Rosa Special Studio a whopping 64 times.  That's got to be a world record for the most asset flip scams from the same template.  Here's some of them so you can see for yourself:

Take a look... these are all [i]exactly the same game![/i]

"Jigsaw" is just a free Github jigsaw template for Unity mobile apps, and doesn't have any merit as a proper, fully fledged PC game, so this lame copy of that template is impossible to recommend.

Asset flips don't involve any professional game development.  All Rosa Special Studio does here is change the puzzle images and then dump the exact same game with different images onto Steam as a cash grab.  Asset flips like this are harmful to the gaming industry and to Steam because they reduce the visibility that sincerely made indie games should have, and make it harder for gamers to find real games from genuine developers.

Don't reward this morally bankrupt, unethical behaviour from Rosa Special Studio/Unreal Quality Games.
This is a pretty good quality jigsaw puzzle game at a low price, but there are only five puzzles which is less than some of my other games. A couple of the pictures are really attractive. There are features like allowing you to separate the edge pieces from the other pieces.[quote][url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asset_flip]Warning: Asset Flip![/url][/quote]

Pichi Girl is an asset flip, what Valve calls a "fake game".  The "developer", Rosa Special Studio/Unreal Quality Games, took the [url=https://github.com/Shit-Just-Got-Real-Studios/Jigsaw]Jigsaw[/url] Unity game template/demo from the real developers, Sh*t-Just-Got-Real Studios, changed the name and added a couple (about 3) stock/low effort images of "anime girls", and dumped the result onto Steam.  They're attempting to scam people into buying this, so they can get your money for someone else's work.

It gets worse... the Jigsaw Github template has been shamelessly dumped on Steam by Rosa Special Studio a whopping 64 times.  That's got to be a world record for the most asset flip scams from the same template.  Here's some of them so you can see for yourself:

<CONTENT>
Prehistoric World: A New Beginning is a strategy game set in an open world. As a representative of a private company, you have been given the task of building a complete, functional dinosaur fauna on a newly discovered planet while maximizing your company's profits. You have more than 42 species of dinosaurs to choose from - herbivores, predators, pterosaurs, aquatic dinosaurs.  You have access to many locations on the planet where you can try to revive the Jurassic era. <br><br>You can organize expeditions and hunts for profit, or you can solve situations by landing on the planet yourself. Technology also allows you to control the brain of any dinosaur you have on the planet. You can also breed dinosaurs, sell their eggs, and perform a variety of tasks. There is also a native alien fauna on the planet that you must suppress.<br><br><br><br><strong>STORY</strong><br>66 million years ago, a 15-kilometre asteroid, Chicxulub, crashed into Earth.  The impact of the trillion-ton meteorite was enormously powerful and caused a worldwide ecological disaster. This catastrophe caused the last known mass extinction at the turn of the Mesozoic Era and ended the dominance of the dinosaurs. The impact created a crater 80 kilometres wide and 30 kilometres deep. The impact released enormous energy, resulting in fires, earthquakes and megatsunamis. The worst effects of the impact lasted 30 years. The impact winter that followed the impact lasted more than a century. The entire planet was affected. The disaster wiped out 75 percent of life on Earth.<br><br>By 2190, scientists had deciphered the dinosaurs' DNA and learned to reconstruct it. In 2220, the technology of traveling at the speed of light was discovered and successfully tested.  The exploration and settlement of planets beyond our solar system began.<br><br>In 2362, a private company, ACTAS, found a planet that is 85% similar to our earth from 66 million years ago. The planet was named Hope. The company decided to reconstruct the dinosaur fauna and use it for commercial purposes. The entire planet was declared a protected reserve. Only paying visitors are allowed on the planet. Some private companies have not recognised this move by ACTAS. The company expects huge profits from this unique attraction.<br><br>The first step was to build a space station in the orbit of Hope. Samples of several dozen dinosaurs were brought to the station. The entire planet has been fairly well mapped. Locations were selected for dinosaur settlement where there is less of an abundance of alien species inhabiting the planet. The company has appointed you director of the planetary colonization project. Your task is to build a functional and harmonious fauna on the planet and maximize the company's profits. And here begins your new adventure!

With the programmable robot having a slight difference in each run, your programming decisions become more and more important for the first several lines of codes as those make a huge change by the end of the level.  Not a game I thought I would enjoy, but have found myself playing it all the time when I'm just sitting at the desk.  I really enjoy the way the scenery changes as the levels progress.  Will update as I complete the remaining levels.

<CONTENT>
Introduction to the game:<br>AOI is a 2d horizontal board platform jumping game similar to the Galaxy Warrior Demon City. You will play the little girl AOI to explore a fantastic world,<br>AOI wakes up from sleep and loses her memory. As the game goes on, her memory will be gradually awakened and the truth of the world will emerge.<br><br><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2212390/extras/attac.png?t=1669951134" /><br><br>- This is a single player adventure game, requiring players to jump, fight, and a little decryption.<br><br>- The game process of this work has a certain degree of freedom, mainly in the following two aspects:<br>     *The game maps are connected, and players can select the attack sequence of the map area to a certain extent.<br>     *Players can pass through the game in the initial state, or win gold coins by defeating the enemy, and then go to the store to buy powerful weapons, energy stones and other ways to improve themselves, and then challenge the boss. Players can decide according to their own preferences.<br><br>- The game has challenging levels and Boss battles.<br><br>- Players can carry 3 kinds of weapons at the same time. The attack means of each weapon are completely different, and they can switch instantaneously, so that players can achieve their unique fighting style and freely combine their fighting skills.<br><br>- There is almost no mandatory plot animation in the game. Players who only like jumping and fighting can completely ignore the plot. Players who like the plot can also explore the plot of the game through NPC dialogues and scattered information.<br><br>The game supports the key modification of the handle and keyboard, and has made the corresponding UI prompt adaptation. Players can set according to their own habits. Players can simply use ordinary attack clearance games. You can also choose to match different weapons to achieve the combination of skills, or grasp the opportunity to fight with the enemy to make yourself invincible. In short, the game design concept is to give players enough freedom to choose their own way to experience this wonderful journey.

<GameName>Full Gear</GameName>
<CONTENT>
<i>Songs of steam and bright machines...</i><br><br><strong>Welcome to Full Gear! </strong>This steampunk-style traditional roguelike is all about information: learn new things, die from an unknown attack, repeat. Use goggles, guns and gadgets to get a gain on the gears, and find... whatever you're looking for down there. You keep forgetting your goal, don't you Devi? Eyes on the prize!<br>With more than 200 unique items to equip, throw, shoot, learn and lose, there's plenty of possibilities to crash your wrench into the drones patrolling the area. And sometimes your own drones as well. Featuring:<br><ul class="bb_ul"><li>8 sprawling areas, all in one giant room, to traverse</li><li>48 unique enemies, completely animated in cute pixel art style</li><li>6 NPC's with their own hopes, dreams, aspirations, and make-shift shops</li><li>9 Boosts and 9 Challenges to make the game harder - or easier - at will</li><li>6 main bosses and 1 final boss</li><li>28 Steam achievements!</li></ul><h2 class="bb_tag">Make Your Own Death Machines</h2>Ah, but using a weapon is never quite enough, is it? You need additional firepower! Gather Parts and combine them in any way you like using local Drone Stations, then let the crafted <strong>Drones </strong>roam near you, distracting and eliminating any threat. You can make a killer robot with three flamethrowers moving at lightning speed - or a cute companion with a taser called Randy. Nobody's safe from Randy. <br><br><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2212500/extras/gif4.gif?t=1669725842" /><h2 class="bb_tag">A Turn Of Events</h2>That cogwheel of yours isn't just for decoration, it's your essence. Whenever a <strong>Token </strong>reaches the top, it'll activate whatever it does - heal you, shield you, give a Crit, give Scrap, or allow a Drone to fire. Re-arrange these Wheel Tokens to whatever you see fit, and before you can say &quot;hey watch this&quot; you deal 40 damage in one attack.<br>Not enough slots for your tokens to fit? No big deal! Swap <strong>cogwheels </strong>to get more slots, stacked slots, special tokens or more regeneration to increase your active capacity. But beware - larger cogwheels may have more slots, but consequently, each slot activate less often.<br><br><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2212500/extras/gif1A.gif?t=1669725842" /><h2 class="bb_tag">Block And Unlock</h2>Many items are locked at first, but in-game <strong>Goals </strong>can be tracked to unlock them. How do you get 5 Curse? Deal 30 damage? Use a Reclaimer? The items you gain from completing goals interact with those mechanics heavily! Additionally, you can simply choose Traditional Mode, where all items are unlocked from the start and Goals are purely cosmetic. Excellent for those living the rogue-life.<br><br><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2212500/extras/gif2A.gif?t=1669725842" /><h2 class="bb_tag">Remembered History</h2>You aren't alone. Maybe that's for the best.<br><br><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2212500/extras/gif3.gif?t=1669725842" /><br><br>There's people down here. Actual people, Devi. Maybe they have some information. You'll need every bit of it.<br>They have stories to tell? About mechanics? Good. About the lore? Hm, is that interesting?<br>Are they of use? They clearly have things they can give you. Maybe it's worth your time after all.<br><br>Getting them out of this place?<br>What, are you insane?<br><br><strong><i>See you around.</i></strong>

As she looks for them, she investigates supernatural cases to get her one step closer to her heritage. <br><br>In this narrative-driven game, you will be able to chat with the people in the town, follow the clues, and fill out your journal along the way.

<GameName>Barbelé</GameName>
<CONTENT>
Barbelé is an Action and 3D Fighting, 3rd person game. It's a story driven adventure in a french prison which offers players dialogue choices.<br />
You will have to do your time in prison, survive in a penitentiary with a real in game timer that you can influence with your action. You can make it pass quicker if you can smuggle things like a phone or books in your cell, or you can even add more time if you get caught fighting or doing anything else illegal.<br />
<br />
Barbelé was born under the name “GS project” for “sacrificed generation”. This idea that young immigrants from the projects go through the same thing over and over again. Like a cycle that does not allow you to move forward. Barbelé wants to be an analysis of society, of the police, of justice, of young people in the projects.<br />
The main feature of Barbelé is combat. The goal of the game is to get out of jail. After being sentenced to 2 years in prison, the player will have to try to survive to get out. A system of &quot;timer&quot; present in the game makes it possible to &quot;do your time&quot; to arrive at the moment when you become free. With each fight that you will make in front of witnesses of the penitentiary administration, you will add time to your sentence, you can even be sent to the &quot;hole&quot; for a given time so that you reflect on your actions.<br />
Several ways will be accessible to &quot;do your time&quot; and finally get out of prison. Not making waves and letting yourself be eaten by ill-intentioned prisoners can get you out sooner with reduced sentences or with your feet first... Fighting intelligently will offer you some advantages without risking increasing your time, and on the other hand, constantly fighting will help to establish your position in the prison, make money and easily get a phone in your cell to prepare for the rest of your incarceration. But this can get you into serious trouble, additional penalties that will constantly delay your exit.<br />
The use of the cell phone will be a major component of the game and there too, it will be necessary to learn to identify the guards' rounds and the schedules to know when it is possible to use the phone without risking being caught, which will result in an additional time, the loss of the phone which is very difficult to recover, and a passage to the hole.<br />
There are other ways to get out of jail...

<GameName>Bounty</GameName>
<CONTENT>
A student project made in Unreal Engine 4 at SAE Expression College. A demo level from our game Bounty.<br />
<br />
Bounty is a first-person shooter bounty-hunting game. The player lands on a space station overrun with robotic bounty hunters. The player must locate and kill the bounty. The player is equipped with a six-shooter that shoots explosive rounds. The player fights through the robot bounty hunters to claim the ultimate prize, his reward. The game is a tactical first-person game. The robots are just as deadly as the six shooters the character wields. The player uses a cover system to avoid being shot. The cover system allows the player to return fire in a deadly firefight a little more safely. The game's plot is to create a mix of wild west gunslingers in a future period. The story behind this bounty hunter is that his father owes money to an intergalactic crime syndicate. This bounty is the “last” job for the crime family before he can free his father from his debt or so he thinks. 7 user reviewsReminds me of Dead Space, the cover system is a really cool idea, makes me think, what if Gears of War could move the cover the way Portal does? A quick and easy play that feels tense the first time through.Cool vibe and fun game, gave me a bit of survival horror vibes tbh. It perhaps could've used more of a tutorial because it took me a bit to really "get" what the mechanics were like, for example at the beginning if the game told you how to crouch that would've been nice. Also, a boss fight near the end might have made it cooler. 

But all in all. This is a great prototype and I can't wait to see level two.This game for a collage project is good one problem I had is that there is no HUD in game i died one time because I didn't know how much health i had lost at the moment then i had to restart at the at the beginning overall good job keep up the good work.Walking is too slow, running is too fast, and everything just feels stiff. The devs seem proud of their dynamic cover system, but I never had to use it because bots can't shoot through railings.pros: Interesting atmosphere, well developed, nice particle effects
cons: needs skip-able cut-scenes, needs a story line to captivate players or something to have them return if a full game is being made, needs direction on how to use cover system, tried reloading but couldn't.

keep up the good work!Pleasantly surprised. Moody space shooter with a pounding soundtrack. Both the visuals and music design create a really strong sense of atmospheric tension, excited to see more!Reminds me of Dead Space, the cover system is a really cool idea, makes me think, what if Gears of War could move the cover the way Portal does?

Why? Not the game, although my thoughts have not changed, and about 4 hours is about all the "playing" there is.
It is because the dev has a very similar game, also at a cost that, is in the same state. If they had one game and were working on it? Sure, pay to get it. But this seems like a copy/paste cash grab, which is super sad, since the bones are there..

EDIT2: The devs response did not shine any light on why they released 2 games that are 20% complete, at the same time. My recommendation stays the same. Are you committed to making a good game, or making 2 games that are not really finished and make 2x as much cash? Pretty clear which the devs chose.

This is super beta material. The instructions (in English at least) are not that helpful and only 1 page saying not a lot.
Lots of stuff is not obvious, like only one of the "team" fights at once.
There is no scroll bar on the left, so it is VERY possible you will not notice there are more things to build (looking at you, Uranium!)
I would say I am half way through, and it has got to the point of my income being well high enough to just get each element, spam the buildings, get the next and repeat. Some balancing required.
There is very little in the way of decisions to make. Just make all the things until you need something (has happened twice in 4 hours...), go swap something over and you are done.

So why am I recommending it? Has good bones, I have enjoyed the 4 hours I have into it, and will probably "finish" it in another 4 or so. Tomorrow. :DGood idea for the game but the game is about 20% finished now. There are a lot of different resources but only few of them have specialized machinery, the rest are just copy-paste. Balance is non-existent, some things don't make sense. Why positive review then? Because I enjoyed playing it for 5 hours until it became obvious that it is not finished yet. So if you want to try it for few hours without expecting a full game, I recommend it.

I am not sure if it will be ever finished as their other game - Mining Copper was released two weeks before this one and also has reviews that say it is unfinished (I didn't play it myself) and instead of finishing one game dev released another.

So what is this game about? There are three parts in it: mining, making and exploration.

Mining:
You have several resources and each one has a machinery chain which basically starts from drilling holes, transforming them into tunnels, digging resources, transporting them, processing them into final product (either green/blue energy or just some resource which you store to use in other chains). Each stage in chain produces next resource and can also produce gold. You use gold to upgrade speed and yield of each stage. Some chains don't make sense, for example, you load impure coal into truck making truckload of coal, then unload truckload of coal into more impure coal at warehouse basically making impure coal out of nothing.

Making:
You use green energy to create 5 types of units. Each unit has rank and level. You produce rank 1 units. You can upgrade their level with gold and you can combine two of the same rank into one of the higher rank of the same type. So to create rank 9 unit you need to make 256 rank 1 units. After rank 9 it requires 4 units of the previous rank to make another, so 1024 rank 1 for rank 10, 4096 for rank 11, etc. After you upgrade a unit to a new level with cash you need to craft enough units to at least get it to the same rank before you can use it, luckily if you combine few units, one of which has higher level resulting level will be the highest of them.

Exploration:
You choose 3 unit types and the first unit of those types (usually the strongest unless you reordered them) goes into battle. Each level initially has 10 enemies, one of which is the boss (which increases by 20 each 5 levels). Rightmost unit attacks the enemy, then central unit attacks the enemy, leftmost unit attacks the enemy, and then finally enemy attacks your rightmost unit, so use tanky unit at the rightmost position. If enemy level is higher than your total level of three units then enemy attacks first otherwise you can just kill them before they get a move if your units are strong enough. You get sources of resources as a reward for exploration which are used to produce initial resource in Mining production chains. The further you get the more rare resource sources you find but because there is nothing special about those resources it is still better to just produce initial resources to convert them to green energy and gold. Yes you get more chains but because they cost more to upgrade they end up slower so increase is not very noticable.

And so that's it. Mine resources, produce green energy and gold, spend gold on upgrades, spend energy on crafting new units, combine units, fight.

This cowboy doesn't have legs so he uses his grappling whip to grapple from A to B. When the whip is attached to a grapple point the player will be pulled towards it. Collect all the gems in a level to progress while swinging. Move the crosshair over a grapple point to attach the whip and move forward. Different kinds of grapple points are scattered around the levels and can act differently based on their color. <br />
<br />
Some of the grapple points move to another place so the player can use them as transport and others give the player more velocity to reach more places. Sometimes it can be beneficial to detach from a point at the right moment to reach a gem or a new point. Watch out for rotating and moving spikes and dropping down in the abyss will make you start over but don’t worry you won’t have to collect all your gems again.<br />

While you discover the city and earn money walking / running / driving / cycling / commuting / <i>etc</i> your backpack around, you will face a number of challenges.<h2 class="bb_tag">Keep An Eye On <strong>Temperatures</strong></h2>Depending on the type of items you carry in your backpack, you need to carefully arrange them in such way that frozen pizzas don't melt and nachos cheese sauce doesn't get cold. You can upgrade it to carry more items or even have better temperature insulation.<h2 class="bb_tag">Make Sure You've Got <strong>Change</strong></h2>Some customers will prefer to pay <i>cash</i>, so make sure to manage your wallet contents carefully and don't forget to visit the ATM every now and then. If you don't have exact change, you can either <i>bargain</i> and hope for the best or make the customer wait ... <i>your rating will likely suffer</i>.<h2 class="bb_tag">Grind Your Way Through <strong>Delivoo Partner Program</strong></h2>While short and easy orders are smooth, longer distance ones will pay more. Even better: rush hour and weather conditions also influences your payment.<br>These perks are only available to Delivoo Partners only, so make sure to keep your rating up and customers happy in order to get <strong>bronze, silver, gold or even platinum</strong> Partner Level.<br><i>PS: There's no rating that many can't magically remove</i><h2 class="bb_tag"> Find your way through Peytor Town </h2>The city is large - so large, in fact, that it has a <strong>shore with a beach, a crowded old town, a busy office area, a picturesque mountain road leading to Holywood grade villas and more</strong>. Getting around the city can prove to be complicated, depending on the vehicle you pick:<br><ul class="bb_ul"><li>Your own two feet<br></li><li>Public transportation <i>(You'll need tickets or subscriptions)</i><br></li><li>Bicycle<br></li><li>E-Bike <i>(You'll need to charge it or spend twice the effort to pedal it)</i><br></li><li>Electric scooter<br></li><li>Car <i>(Gas, maintenance, taxes, parking passes, all that jazz)</i><br></li><li>Electric Car <i>(Pick a good one)!</i></li></ul>You can either <strong>rent</strong> or <strong>buy</strong> dozens of vehicles of this type and leave them around town so you can easily switch between them to beat the traffic and deliver that hotdog as it's still steaming hot!

 The story was intriguing and made me think a lot about my own personal struggles with life and thoughts of suicide. 

I was truly enjoying my time with this game until i got about an hour in and couldn't progress. There was a page with a youtube link that i could not decipher despite trying for a good fifteen minutes or so. Disappointing as i was looking forward to seeing how the game would end. 

Overall 6/10

<strong>HEY! This game is still a work in progress, and a LOT is being changed. Stick around for more info!</strong><br><br>Scrapbox is a frantic 2.5D fighter where a bunch of strange specimen beat each other up for little to no reason.<h2 class="bb_tag">ACCESSIBILITY FIRST</h2>Scrapbox was made with casual <i>and </i>competitive play in mind as opposed to leaning super heavily in either direction. The game has very easy inputs consisting of a direction, a button press, and your character's position (in air or grounded) instead of super difficult inputs that take 7.346 trillion years to learn. To make up for the game being easy to control, each character has a boat load of attacks - 8 Light Moves, 8 Mid Moves, 8 Strong Moves, 8 Special Moves and 3 Ultra Moves.<h2 class="bb_tag">SOME TECH, YES</h2>This game has a few ways to cancel moves. There's jump cancelling, which affects everything but Ultras, which is performed by inputting a jump during a small window as you attack. Land cancelling exists too - landing during an aerial cancels it immediately. On top of that, you can air dash in 4 directions, wave dash, dodge roll, and much more!<h2 class="bb_tag">ACHIEVEMENTS GALORE</h2>There are multiple achievements to snag for doing the most bizarre things possible. Every update brings new ones!<h2 class="bb_tag">MODES</h2>Just in case regular fighting gets old, there are a handful of other modes for you to enjoy!<br><br><ul class="bb_ul"><li><strong>TRAINING MODE</strong> lets you, well, train. You can see every character's hitboxes, speed up or slow the game down and more to let you lab with your favourite character!<br></li><li><strong>CAMEO KICKER</strong> has you punting tons of flying discs imprinted with characters that didn't quite make the cut. Good old arcade fun!<br></li><li><strong>TOUR MODE</strong> is the game's platform fighter hybrid, with huge stages and plenty of enemies to smack. Speed through the level or take your time battering each enemy one by one!<br></li><li><strong>CHAOS MODE</strong> throws balancing out the window and randomises every character's attributes. Good luck, have fun!<br></li><li><strong>TAG TEAM MODE</strong> lets you choose up to three different fighters and tag them in and out mid-match. If all three get KO'd, you're out!<br></li><li><strong>STORY MODE</strong> tells the most bizarre story ever seen in a fighting game. 'Nuff said.</li></ul>

<GameName>Polaris Outpost</GameName>
<CONTENT>
You find yourself alone on a remote research outpost in the Polaris system. Something has gone terribly wrong. Much of the base is lacking power and your co-workers are mysteriously missing. There is a deadly threat lurking in this outpost and it will take all of your cunning to keep from becoming another victim.<br><br>Your resources are dwindling, so you'll need to secure more food, water, and power, but this involves venturing away from the security of your home base. Equipped with various items to track, deter, and trick your adversary, there is a chance you can outwit your opponent. However, you'll need to keep a close eye on your stats, as it's all too easy to get dehydrated or lose your sanity to the extreme stress of these circumstances.<br><br>You will need to explore deep into your opponent's territory to find a way to escape this outpost. A distress signal may take too long, so maybe you can get the escape shuttle up and running instead. Or maybe there is a way to actually defeat this adversary. One thing is for certain, this won't be easy. Your adversary is becoming more intelligent by the minute, and it is adapting to resist your weapons. You'll need to move quickly and find more powerful equipment if you expect to stand a chance. Can you survive Polaris Outpost?<br><br><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2209080/extras/Vertical_No_text.png?t=1668453444" /><br><br>Polaris Outpost is a blend of survival, horror, and minimalist base building. It involves both planning ahead and thinking on your feet in order to survive. You will be up against a single powerful adversary that evolves to become stronger and more intelligent throughout the game. You will secure resource production rooms and find ways to defend or repair them. The gameplay is often tense and frightening as you try to out maneuver and outsmart your deadly opponent in a variety of atmospheric sci-fi environments. The game becomes progressively more open-ended, giving you more of a chance to make your own decisions.

A detailed hit simulation and health system will mean that even non-lethal hits can render a survivor unable to go on. Suppressive fire might pin an enemy in place, but the ammunition used up may leave you ill-equipped to fight the next encounter effectively<br><br><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2209140/extras/Explosion_-_Resized.gif?t=1669149424" /><h2 class="bb_tag">DRIVE RESTORED VEHICLES</h2>It's a big world out there. To get around you will need better transportation than your legs can provide. One of the things setting Ascent of Ashes apart from other games of this genre is the ability to restore and drive vehicles.<br><br><br><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2209140/extras/Vehicles_-_Resized.gif?t=1669149424" /><h2 class="bb_tag">LEAD YOUR SURVIVORS</h2>Each survivor has their own unique personality and motivations.

To survive the post-apocalypse you'll have to brave the pre-collapse ruins and the many dangers that they hold.<br><br><br><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2209140/extras/Floaters_-_Resized.gif?t=1669149424" /><h2 class="bb_tag">CHALLENGE A DYNAMIC AI</h2>It's not enough to just have an in-depth combat system with a variety of mechanics. You also need opponents capable of using those mechanics to challenge you. Enemies will possess varying degrees of intelligence. Taking on a disorganized band of raiders will play very differently from fighting a squad of well-trained Remnant soldiers.<br><br><br><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2209140/extras/Dynamic_AI_-_Resized.gif?t=1669149424" /><h2 class="bb_tag">FROM THE ORGINAL CREATORS OF COMBAT EXTENDED</h2>Combining the deep simulation of classic post-apocalyptical survival titles with the tactical challenge of classic real time and turn-based gems, the original creators of RimWorld's heralded <strong>Combat Extended</strong> mod present a fresh take on the colony sim genre that emphasizes exploration, tight balance and strategic gameplay.<h2 class="bb_tag">MODDING SUPPORT</h2>Our team has its roots in mod-making and we've been fortunate to have been part of many great modding communities over the years. That's why with Ascent of Ashes, we want to give something back to those communities. We're building the game's engine from the ground up to be easily extendable, and thanks to our extensive experience in creating mods ourselves we know exactly what kind of support mod-makers need. Ascent of Ashes is a game developed by modders, for modders.

Though, tragedy isn’t the same as lightning and it likes to strike the same person twice.<br><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2208610/extras/Explore.png?t=1670247112" /><br><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2208610/extras/Gif_2.gif?t=1670247112" /><br>Accompany Sky and experience the struggles and difficulties she'll have to face and overcome; the lessons she will have to learn, the things she'll have to risk and sacrifice on a  journey towards the end.

<GameName>Bebop</GameName>
<CONTENT>
Set in a distant future, a dystopian society struggles with crime and prostitution. In a dark alley, a sign on the door reads: &quot;Bebop, private investigator&quot;. But is he a private investigator really? I DON'T THINK SO. Bebop is involved with the mob, and he is about to embark on a journey without return. I mean, he will return home, but NOT THE SAME as before. Bebop will meet people that will shape his personality, he will go after those who wronged him, and he will, in the end, reach the end of his story. OR IS HE?<br />
<br />
This amazing adventure was written by Luis Felipe Pimenta, in his first attempt at creating a game. Hopefully, it won't be his last. His team is made of programmers doing artwork and artists doing programming.<br />
<br />
Bebop is a platform side-scroller pixel art adventure. Use physics to solve puzzles, travel through different places in Cybercity to complete your quests. <br />
<br />
Features:<br />

Along the way, you will encounter many deadly bosses and engage in challenging, strategic turn-based combat. You decide how to build your party, mixing-and-matching between 9 different classes, each with drastically different strengths and weaknesses. You can change classes any time, so experiment frequently to craft the perfect strategy for each enemy!<h2 class="bb_tag">Features</h2><ul class="bb_ul"><li>Over <strong>40 boss fights,</strong> each with their own unique mechanics. Expect multiple phases, colourful gimmicks, and ruthless attacks. <br></li><li><strong>No game-overs:</strong> Your progress is saved after every battle. Defeat simply means a chance to try again. <br></li><li>Study your enemies ahead of time by viewing the <strong>Boss Log,</strong> where you can find a record of your greatest foes and a description of their attacks. You must prepare to counter their strategies with a plan of your own!<br></li><li>Class-based combat system that's simple to learn, hard to master. <strong>Swap classes before any battle</strong> to arm yourself for the fight ahead. Find a combo that works for you and stick to it, or experiment frequently to find the perfect squad. <br></li><li><strong>9 main classes to choose from.</strong> Need more firepower?

Waking up in an asylum as one of its patients, you realize the doctor in charge has horrible plans for you. However, when you fall asleep, that's when you realize the true horrors of your situation. Your dreams are plagued by an alternate version of the asylum, where monsters inhabit the facility, and the laws of reality have been left behind. Using a modified flashlight with 3 different modes you discover that your world can be changed at the press of a button. Using this you can solve puzzles, defeat monsters, and explore parts of the asylum that defy reality to find your escape.<h2 class="bb_tag">Gameplay &amp; Features</h2><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2228840/extras/waterfall_steam_.gif?t=1670604461" /><br><ul class="bb_ul"><li>Puzzles &amp; Riddles<br></li><li>Multiple rooms and locations to explore<br></li><li>Story items to collect<br></li><li>Multiple weapons to find<br></li><li>Player powers<br></li><li>Merchants &amp; Upgrading<br></li><li>Boss fights<br></li><li>Multiple endings</li></ul><h2 class="bb_tag">Developer Inspiration</h2><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2228840/extras/EnemyStun_steam_.png?t=1670604461" /><br>When I started this project I didn't want to make a game with cheap jump scares or classic horror clichés. I wanted to create an experience that genuinely surprises the player and makes them feel like they never truly know what's going to happen next. From day one, I've always wanted the world to feel alive and story-wise it needs to. The world you exist in is not one based in reality and is carefully crafted to the player's actions in the game. The way you play changes the world around you, and I thought this was a really concept to explore.

Literally like 10 people knew this game existed, and I was one of them.

A huge thank you to Dreams Interactive and Strategy First for giving this game a chance to to be discovered again, it's an amazing little hidden gem that's just as addictively fun to play as it was when I played it as a kid. Though relatively simple nowadays, this very grungy cyberpunk/industrial Wipeout clone captivated me growing up.

My only complaint is that they seem to have not implemented the music for the game, possibly due to licensing issues (though the music label still appears on billboards in game and the music track selector still has the names of the songs). Growing up, I know that the game wouldn't play the music unless you had the CD in the drive, but you could still play the game without the music if you didn't have the disc. It could be that they just didn't implement the features that were on disc. If you want, go ahead and buy this version, but if you can find a copy on disc, get that too so you can experience the game with the music as originally intended by the original developers.I never imagined for the life of me that one of my favorite little bargain bin games growing up would ever make it on Steam.

<br />
Now also available on desktop, its main intent is to be a game that can be played when you just want to relax. It can run in its own smaller window so you can do things on the side if you wish. No time pressure, play at your own pace and you can stop the game at any time to return where you left off later.<br />

The main gameplay involves aiming and firing the turrets. Since turrets take 30 seconds to reload, the player must utilize multiple turrets on multiple ships to maximize their firepower. Things are made more difficult due to the movement of the ships and the sea, and consistent accuracy will be a challenge to all but the most experienced gunner. Sink all the enemy boats to achieve victory - with bonus points earned for quickness.<br><br>The game follows, in a fictional sense, the major battlecruiser engagements in WWI such as the Battles of Heligoland Bight and Jutland, which would be the last time ships of this kind reigned supreme before improvements to high-flying aircraft and deep-diving submarines made them all but obsolete. <br><br>Dreadnought-era battleships and battlecruisers are similar in size and firepower, but differ in terms of armor thickness, turret layout, and speed. Battleships are more heavily armored, whereas battlecruisers have the advantage in mobility. <br><br>The player will have an opportunity to board both types of ship and unleash mighty salvos upon the opposing fleet.

Help Mr. Ball have a safe and comfortable trip 1 user reviewsI appreciate it's smooth controls. The game is just as described, every jump requires precision and patience for the right moments. I'm glad I wasn't able to save on my own and load the save if I fell, I feel like the challenge of the game would be reduced too much. Having to start from wherever you land is demoralizing, but I found it to be a part of the fun. Something I wasn't aware of at the start is how much your jump is charged, I was able to figure this out by seeing the light beneath Mr. Ball growing brighter.

You can play freely! In the great power play, it is a pleasure to let money talk about things, gather nuclear weapons and shoot them in unison!<br />
It is also good to have a hard fight by tying up various things with small forces! You may lay down a small country with a large army!<br />
<br />
It also comes with a small storytelling scenario that covers all but major battles!<br />
In addition to that, it also includes small-scale conflicts such as the &quot;Battle of Malawi&quot; and IF's wars such as the &quot;Second Korean War&quot;!<br />
You can enjoy various big and small battles with this one piece!<br />
<br />
Also, this work was created in 2021, so it does not reflect the times.<br />
Please understand.

Masa Gorse 3 user reviewsReview at: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijQvCQ__Df4&t=10s
Well this game is not what I expected. A single small environment where you fight a single monster. No explanation of what the point of the story for this game is. No clear instructions on buttons. The only way to get out of the middle of the game is a hard exit or you die. The monster and you can glitch on invisible walls or rocks.The game is pretty and the monster looks cool but that is where the positives end. 

Firstly, the game is using 100% of my GPU. Performance aside, it is not clear at all what you're supposed to do. You can't even look up the controls in the options. You are just dropped into the forest with no weapon or any idea of how to make one, while the OST of the Witcher 3 if it was composed and performed by a drunkard blares in the background.

It has potential, but it needs some more work.

Edit:
The good news is that I found the weapons, the bad is the combat is just terrible.

The player plays the role of a prison officer in a women's prison who is in charge of the inmates. <br />
<br />
· This is a prison themed role-playing and simulation business game.<br />
· The player assumes the role of a prison guard in charge of a prison.<br />
· The player needs certain strategies to keep the prison running properly and keep the indicators above a certain score.<br />
· Different prisoners have different levels of violence.<br />
· Grow assets as much as possible.<br />
· Increase order as much as possible.<br />
· If you've ever fantasized about being a prison guard and managing prisoners in your own way, don't miss this game! 1 user reviewsBought the game and tried it. I don't understand how the game works, there is no "help" or anything. It just wants you to do random bullshit without telling you what they need to do like feeding them or etc. There's no instruction or anything to help us enjoy the game. Waste of money

Cats will hide in all apartments of a multi-storey building. Search every corner of the room, move the pillows, open the bedside tables, check the toilet.... Cats can hide in the most unpredictable places.<br><br><strong>Key Features:</strong><br>- 5 floors;<br>- 250 cats;<br>- Hints;<br><br>During the development of this game, we were motivated by the game &quot;<i>A Building Full of Cats</i>&quot;. 9 user reviewsNow if you have played [i]A Building Full of Cats[/i] then you'll find this game strangely familiar. There is a thread in which the creator mentions that they did reach out to the other team asking for permission to borrow the concept which is to clear out several floors that are full of cats.

These levels have their own theme, colour and music. There is one scrollable screen on each floor and a bathroom you have to enter. Now, of the two games this appears to be the lesser one (there are no animations when changing floors) but I enjoyed it just the same. Looking for secret cats that require interaction with objects on our part is just pure fun! 

Perhaps it's best to start with this one of the two games so that the experience with [i]A Building Full of Cats[/i] will be a bit more enjoyable.A blatant rip off of another game with basically the same title, and this one is not as good.  All cats found within 30 minutes, and there are no secrets or surprises.  Achievements don't count on your profile.  I'd recommend the other game over this one.   I'm still giving this one a positive, because it's fine for what it is at the sale price of 40% off.In the game you need to find cute cats in different places of the room, all rooms are unique and visually beautiful.Has lovely colors, has lovely music, and the dev fixes bugs immediately. Is it similar to A Building Full of Cats? Indeed it is since the dev was inspired to make this game due to the other game. Listen folks, we can't get enough hidden kitty games so if you enjoy these types of games then pick this one up as wellI found some cats... Shocker.

<CONTENT>
As you come home from a long journey to see your son once more, you discover he is gone. A castle has been presumably summoned from thin air and it has a dark, gloomy presence to it. With this castle appearing, all the colours also disappeared, leaving everything looking lifeless. You hear a woman's voice in your head, beckoning you toward the castle. After grabbing your ancient shield and trusty boomerang you go towards an adventure that you simply don't know how will end. All you know is that you are going to save your son, no matter what it takes.<br><br><u><i>Gameplay:</i></u><br>The Search for a Colour Palette (TSFACP) has 7 levels in total, each ending with a boss at the end. Inspired by the classic Castlevania games from the 80's, you have to fight your way through monsters, unknown creatures, and beasts in order to get to your final destination: the castle. <br><br>At your disposal you have a boomerang that you can throw and also hover in the air with, knives you can pick up throughout the levels and throw at enemies for additional damage, and a holy shield with which you can block damage and jump on top of enemies. You also gain experience from killing enemies, making you even stronger...be careful not to kill too many though. Use all of these tools to your advantage, because there are some platforming challenges to be had in your adventure!<br><br><u><i>Credits:</i></u><br><strong>SeventyFour Productions</strong> - Programming, graphic design, spritework, cover art, mechanics<br><strong>Bro.

<img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2203610/extras/Follow.gif?t=1669738693" /><br><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2203610/extras/ant.gif?t=1669738693" /><br>Ants of Duty is a strategy game about managing a small colony of ants that find themselves in an unknown territory. You have to help them cope with the huge dangers on their way, such as red ants, wasps and crabs, so that the ants find their way back to their home. Get resources, build an army and defeat enemies.Особенности: a game for the speed of development of the colony, many different opponents, a game with a choice of consequences. PositiveThis is a scam; ignore the positive reviews--they have nothing to do with this 'game' and are completely misleading.  

Where to begin?  The main menu has 2 options:  Play and exit.  No options.  No instructions.  No tutorial.  Once you start the game, its even worse.  No instructions, terrible graphics.  

Gameplay consists of pressing 3 possible buttons (Q, A, and Z) to summon a worker ant (Q) or some fighter ants (the others).  The works automatically (and with about the stupidest AI imaginable) collect a leaf while you 'control' the warrior ants by clicking on them and sending them to attach the enemy 'base' which is always to the right by clicking on it.  No strategy, no depth.  There's one resource (leaves).  You can't build anything except the 3 types of ants.  Can't build any buildings. 

Oh, and usually if you try to select your ants, it takes about a half dozen times before the game registers it.  Imagine a RTS where there's 1 resource, 3 units which have almost nonexistent AI, completely empty levels, asset flip graphics and--somehow--a completely buggy UI that doesn't register your clicks most of the time.  That's 'Ants of Duty'.  Thank goodness for Steam's refund policy.Interesting game where you can feel like a king ant, it's interesting and fun, I advise you this game, there is interesting gameplay, convenient controls, it is not expensive and worth it to try to play, I really liked it

<GameName>Shadow Lens</GameName>
<CONTENT>
Shadow Lens is a found-footage video game set in the 90s. The game was never finished, its release in 2000 was due to developer negligence. I obtained the original code for the game and ported it to PC for you to play. There is a lot of unused content in the game files that can only be accessed with cheats. <br />
<br />
The game case reads:<br />
--------------------------------------------------<br />
Monsters lurk across your uncle's farm.<br />
Collect tools to unlock new areas.<br />
Upgrade your camera to navigate the darkness.<br />
Find your missing daughter.<br />
Discover what happened to her.<br />
Solve puzzles to get items.<br />
Complete quests for the locals.<br />
Get slimed and try again!<br />
--------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
The player is thrust into the role of a nameless protagonist tasked with investigating the strange happenings on an old farm. Discover the mystery of what happened to your daughter, Hantu. On the journey finding a plethora of tools and items to aid in her search. For example, your upgradable polaroid camera can be used to aluminate dark spaces. But be careful, because monsters often hide in these areas and are hard to see. To find Hantu, puzzles involving items must be solved. Most items can be interacted with, consumed, or picked up with your hand. Mastery of the tools and consumables is the key to finding Her. Hidden secrets from Cheat Codes to Unlockable areas litter the landscape. It is up to you to find them. Are you brave enough to look within the shadows and find Hantu?

This game is a Virtual Reality First Person target shooting experience. You go through each environment in your elevator and clear the targets. The faster you clear them, the more points you get. Its THAT simple! 3 user reviewsI just can't recommend this freebie. I don't think it works as an aim trainer because the gun model is so bad and I don't know of a single VR game that this would train you for. The "gun model" doesn't even have iron sights. 

Also, this free to play title needs better optimization. I was getting shaky gameplay on my RTX 3080. I literally felt like I was doing target practice in the middle of an LA earthquake. 

It has a few levels. I did the levels several times before the 5 minutes was up so that I could post a review. I just wanted to quit real quick and never play again. Good luck to the dev, with some polish, this may be a good target practice / aim trainer in the future, but it's not there currently.I just can't recommend this freebie.

The pictures do not do it justice, this game is beautiful, my jaw dropped at one point. It's also very fun, i love exploring and looking in every corner so this game suits me perfectly. What i thought would entertain me for 10 minutes, i ended up playing for an hour and a half and i still haven't found everything. If you like exploring or collecting all the objectives i cannot recommend this enough.

Edit: I kind of missed this in my playthrough but you can take some really beautiful pictures in the game, check out the devs on twitter to see some of the bestNice and relaxing game you can spend time in and just explore and take pictures you like.00111110 00100000 01001111 01100010 01101010 01100101 01100011 01110100 00111010 00100000 01001110 01100101 01101101 00110000 00101101 00110001 00001101 00001010 00111110 00100000 01001111 01100010 01101010 01100101 01100011 01110100 01101001 01110110 01100101 00111010 00100000 01000011 01100001 01110000 01110100 01110101 01110010 01100101 00100000 01101100 01101001 01110110 01101001 01101110 01100111 00100000 01100010 01100101 01101001 01101110 01100111 01110011 00100000 01101001 01101110 00100000 01110100 01101000 01100101 00100000 01100001 01101110 01101111 01101101 01100001 01101100 01101111 01110101 01110011 00100000 01111010 01101111 01101110 01100101 00001101 00001010 00111110 00100000 01010011 01110100 01100001 01110100 01110101 01110011 00111010 00100000 01010010 01110101 01101110 01101110 01101001 01101110 01100111

[*]+ Availability: the game is free
[*]+ Beautiful graphics
[*]+ Professional camera
[*]+ Lots of living creatures to shoot
[*]+ Open world
[*]+ Pleasant nature sounds
[*]+ Unobtrusive soundtrack
[*]+ Simple controls
[*]+ Lots of filters and camera settings
[*]+ In-game encyclopedia
[*]+ To photograph some creatures, you will need endurance and patience

[b]Did not like:[/b]
[*]- Lack of settings
[*]- A small number of frames available for shooting
[*]- A bug at the beginning of the game: when using the prone position for the first time, the character could not stand up again. Until he fell off the cliff.
[*]- At times, when moving through the vines - the character's head begins to spin wildly.[/list]

[b]Conclusion:[/b]
A great little Indie-game in which the player simply has to explore a small map - and take photos of the animals they encounter. The more beautiful and "correct" the photo is taken, the better it will look in the encyclopedia.
An almost real camera is available to the player - in which he can not only use zoom, but also rotate, filters, and adjust the exposure / contrast of the photo. True, during all the manipulations - time does not stand still, therefore, having set the necessary parameters, the player will have to be patient - in order to catch an interesting frame again.
Not all living creatures in the world are harmless - and can sometimes fight back if the player gapes and gets too close. But do not worry - there is no concept of death in the game - after shutdown, the Robot will be restored at the last boot server.
The game is not big, but it's nice to spend time in it - having a rest from the industrial world in the bosom of nature.

But be sure that your target is a dove and not a crow or songbird or you’ll have to pay a fine for breaking the game laws! <br><br>Earn money for each dove that you bag and spend your earnings to buy new guns or “power ups” for a day (such as highlighting downed birds to make them easier to see).

Can you collect all of the 40+ band locations? Other, even more rare, birds await you in the field as well! <br><br><br><u><strong>Your Hunting Land</strong></u><br>Explore as you hunt your own private 550 acre hunting land. This area is dove heaven, containing sunflower fields, hay fields, wooded thickets and stock tanks. You hunt with a full 24 hour day-night cycle, so you can use your headlamp to get to your hunting spot before sunrise or find that bird that you downed just before shooting hours closed at sunset. <br><br>The realistic dove AI means that you are much more likely to find doves feeding in the early morning and evening, roosting through the midday, and sipping water and picking up some gravel in late mornings and early afternoons. <br><br>Doves can follow different patterns on different days, meaning that spot where you bagged your limit on a previous day may not be nearly as busy the next time you hunt. It is important to know where, and when, feeding and watering areas are…and where the birds roost, as you may kick some birds out of their roost by walking through! <br><br><br><u><strong>Hunt Your Way</strong></u><br>Hunting Life VR: Dove Season allows you customize your hunting experience to be what you want it to be. Do you want a realistic hunting experience with just a few doves that can spot you if you’re not in cover? Go for it! Or maybe you prefer tons of doves with no non-game birds? We’ve got you covered! Want to forget about game laws and just go out and have fun bagging birds with no limits? You can do that too!<br><br><br><u><strong>Action Challenge</strong></u><br>When you’ve gotten comfortable with hunting doves in Dove Season, be sure to try out the Action Challenge where you are set in the path of a never-ending flock of doves and you must down as many as you can before time runs out! Special silver and gold doves are worth more points and they add to your time. Stringing hits together will increase your score multiplier. Action Challenge takes it all: speed, accuracy, target recognition! <br><br>Hunting Life VR lets you enjoy the outdoors your way! <br><br><u><strong>Achievements</strong></u><br>Try to obtain 15 different Steam Achievements, including: <br><ul class="bb_ul"><li><strong>Peas in a Pod</strong> - Down two doves that hit the ground within 3 yards of each other. <br></li><li><strong>Double Trouble</strong> - Down two doves within 2 seconds.<br></li><li><strong>Not a Lost Cause</strong> - Bag 100 doves in a row without losing a single bird.</li></ul><br>Achievements are displayed in-game (per save) in the &quot;farm house&quot;. Some special achievements unlock shotgun skins that can only be obtained through earning the achievement! <br><br><strong><u>Lama glama Game Company</u></strong><br>We are an indie game company and we have roots in the game industry, specifically with hunting games.

You can view my initial impressions & gameplay here: https://youtu.be/8WVSDbPqN78

I think Hunting Life VR has a good concept. A semi-realistic hunting setup which has you specifically hunting for doves. While the concept is neat, the execution is not. I find it difficult to say anything else positive about the experience.

The biggest thing (maybe) is that the visuals are poor, but also the game is poorly optimized. The game also has arcade-like gun mechanic that has you holding the shotgun with one hand. The gun mechanics are poor overall & just not realistic, along with the reloading being very finnicky. The game also has poor sounds & ugly UI.

Game is running on the Unity Engine. On my RTX 3080, I was getting variable frame rates from 40 to 90 fps throughout, although I did have all the graphical options set to max. You do have full locomotion, along with smooth or snap turning. The VR interactions are very basic here. You hold the shotgun in one hand, you spawn a shell in the off hand. You press grab to open the shotgun chamber with your off-hand and holding down. I had to try multiple times to reload the shotgun.

Overall, this game is just too expensive given the lack of polish, visuals, sounds, presentation, etc. I cannot recommend it.

You are surrounded by Australian wildlife and most of it is as deadly as it comes. You have no memory of who you are and how you got here. You also find out that people appear to have abandoned this area. <br><br>Surviving in the Australian outback isn't easy - it is an extremely harsh environment with extreme temperatures, low rainfall, and little vegetation. The water is scarce. You will have to find your own strategy to survive, manage the heat and gather food. <br><br>Who are you and how did you get here?<br><br>Why are you alone?<br><br>Why did people leave this place?<br><br>How do you get back to civilisation?<br><br>And finally, are you really alone...<br><br><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2201540/extras/Survival.png?t=1669718844" /><br>Australian wildlife isn't the friendliest in the world. Kangaroos and dingoes can be aggressive, but saltwater crocodiles or the eastern brown snake will most likely cause your death if you get too close to them. <br><br>You will have to develop your own strategy to survive. You can either approach them directly with a weapon you crafted earlier, or you can build traps and prepare poisoned baits. <br><br>However, wildlife isn't your biggest problem. Extreme temperatures and dehydration is what usually kills people stranded in the Australian outback. You must find water. You must find shade. You may consider sleeping through the heat of the day and explore the outback at a night time. Or you can gather as much water as you can and continue exploring. You may carefully plan the trip so you stay shaded for most of it.

<GameName>Rocket Escape</GameName>
<CONTENT>
Rocket Escape is an innovative 2D platformer about rocket jumping your way to the goal. Despite being around in gaming for a long time, rocket jumping is usually relegated to a side mechanic. However, we believed that rocket jumping could be so much more. Featuring mechanics such as slow motion/rocket time, speedrunning timers, black hole rockets, and more, Rocket Escape is an expansion on the time-tested concept of rocket jumping. We at Compact Square Studios have been working on Rocket Escape as a passion project over the last few years, and we are excited to be able to release the game on Steam and share it with the world.<br><br>We look forward to seeing how you approach and enjoy the game!<br><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2201680/extras/pickuplaunchersmol.png?t=1670204722" /> 6 user reviewsRocket Escape is a game that takes a lot from Portal.
It's short, it's fun, and it's not something that's really been done before.
For just a few bucks, I'd say it's a great buy.From its inception in 2020 to release in 2022 Rocket Escape has been a labor of love from the burgeoning studio Compact Square. With its simplistic yet detailed art style and portal-esque puzzle levels, Rocket Escape leaves the player not only wanting to finish the game, but also to reach perfection with its level clock. The easy mode makes the game accessible for those less game inclined. The level editor is sure to bring us a ton of fun for a long time to come.

<GameName>IN CELL</GameName>
<CONTENT>
IN CELL is a kinetic visual novel (linear, no choices) about the epidemic of sexless, nationless, and friendless men.  Gender dynamics are currently not functional, sustainable, or beneficial to either men or women.  IN CELL is an uncensored conversation between the sexes.  Not that such a conversation will solve anything.<br />
<br />
There are no specific characters, just mostly nameless men, and women.  It is better to think of men and women as the characters rather than specific people.  There are themes of racism, violence, sex, porn, and pretty much anything you could think of that may bother you.  There's a healthy dose of memes too as the subject matter necessitates it.<br />
<br />
You'll enjoy the hot new dating app &quot;Let's **** Chad!&quot;  You'll consider violence a reasonable solution.  You'll hate, you'll love, and you'll be numb.  IN CELL while primarily written by me does include direct quotes of men from youtube, 4chan, reddit, and other corners of the internet.<br />
<br />
IN CELL does not come from a place of wanting to solve the problem.  It is merely a talking point in the form of a visual novel.  I wanted to write about the modern male experience.  I was inspired by innumerable sources that I won't name as they may not want to be associated with this work.  I've read books, watched hundreds of thousands of hours of youtube videos, browsed forums, and have gone outside.<br />
<br />
I, like many other men, do not like this world.  IN CELL is about our experience as men.

Two words: Finnish Anime.

Definitely an enjoyable time to stream for some friends but you may want a few drinks, too. It's almost like fan-fiction of itself.

Constructive criticisms as of 11/25/2022:
1. Melee range is MUCH too far, it feels like enemies slap you from across the map.

2. The combat aiming cursor is frustrating, to put it lightly. It needs to show exactly where the mouse is or keep the same rotational speed regardless of distance from the middle of the screen, and lock the mouse to the screen. I found myself clicking off of the game mid-combat which was driving me nuts.

3. Adding use of the number pad in first-person fights would help a lot, those are hard. Increase time between block and attack a little. (Honestly, I'd replace it with just W, A, S, D, and Spacebar instead of 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 0, Spacebar.)

4. The enemies in the final boss fight do too much damage and attack WAY too fast, don't even try to get close to them.It was $2 well spent. I had a great time with it. Then I spent another $2 to buy it for a friend. 

The art style is very unique but it made me smile.

The game is BRUTALLY difficult. The melee range is very long and there aren't any swipe vfx or anything to tell how far melee swings are. Some visual effects would really help so you could see the swings. The melee enemies don't really have a 'tell' for when they attack, so melee back and forth combat is very difficult. The aiming is really weird. The cursor is used to aim, but the cursor is invisible. If the cursor was visible, the aiming style would work a lot better. Please make the cursor visible. 

The hand to hand combat sequences are fun but I think a Guitar Hero/Rhythm game style where the number drops down on a track would be a little more fun. The pauses between the enemy's attacks are very inconsistent and sometimes there are long pauses where they don't attack at all.

The mini games for upgrades don't have a "help" screen or tutorial, and some are very confusing (the sauna for example). And if you fail the mini game, you don't get an upgrade, which feels pretty bad. 

The HP and ammo types are all just text on the screen, I'd love to see actual UI icons. Hearts instead of numbers for health, bow and arrow icon with a number next to it for arrow ammo, etc.

The cutscenes and storyline was the real star of the show. It was a ton of fun to see.This game is really hard. Just like me when watching 'em manly cutscenes.

I hate the duels, they're super annoying giving you little next to no time to think. Getting to finish your opponent after is satisfying thoBoth people who reviewed this game are psychopaths and cannot be trusted. Do not believe their lies

Cowboys and Zombies... What can go wrong?<br />
<br />
Prove that you are the fastest gunslinger in the old west by literally shooting with your bare hands. You have to be quick or the zombies will eat you...<br />
<br />
The game has two modes: Story mode and Hands tracking or Time mode.<br />
In the story mode the player can move freely around the stage, he will have to find the way to go to the next level.<br />
<br />
In hands tracking mode, the player remains static in one position, having to survive the zombie attack for a certain amount of time. You can use the Quest, Quest 2 and Quest Pro goal cameras, to play, you do not need controllers. Playing without controllers is less accurate, but can be more fun...<br />
<br />
Designed for Pico 4, Oculus Meta Quest 2, Valve Index, Pimax, HTC Vive and Quest Pro PC-VR, Hands Tracking Mode. 2 user reviews[h1]Experienced on the Meta Quest 2[/h1]

<GameName>Forge of Destiny</GameName>
<CONTENT>
Faced with the impossibility of halting the extinction of humanity, a planetary contingency plan was activated for the relocation and protection of the surviving people. Promoted and financed by the world's leading technology company of the time, Inductrack, a program was devised to build colossal metropolis contained in domes or vaults, which would be known as Nodes or dome-cities.<br><br>Although originally there were more than three thousand Nodes, the number of operational dome-cities is not known at present. Political instability and constant internal conflicts, as well as the altercations that occurred during the insurrection of the rebel coalition of Diurna against the government of the Regency of Omnis, provoked confrontations that, in many cases, ended with the total destruction of the structures that provide vital support to the domes.<br><br>Gradually, the idea of finding another way of life fell into oblivion. The Nodular Governments rewrote the events of the past to maintain absolute control over the inhabitants of the dome-cities, who submitted to the idea of isolation and the impossibility of leaving their own Nodes, believing that there was no existence but themselves.<h2 class="bb_tag">The control of truth</h2>.<br>At present, VΣRÐΔÐ is the only truth that exists. The citizens of the Nodes are engaged in the search for arcana in order to increase their influence and thus acquire privileges based on their reputation. Meanwhile, Diurna maintains her combative spirit, organizing assaults and skirmishes, hoping that, one day, the scales will finally tip in her favor.<h2 class="bb_tag">1st Chapter</h2><br>Enter the universe of &quot;Forge of Destiny&quot; as an inhabitant of the Fourth Node-capital. Discover the secrets hidden in the sands of the ruin district and witness the beginning of your story. An initial journey that will lead you to discover the reality of a new society built on the ruins of the past. Thus, finding the truth will be essential to discover what really happens within the walls of the Node-capital.<h2 class="bb_tag">The Forge of Destiny</h2><br>This first chapter, which begins the saga &quot;Forge of Destiny&quot;, has been coordinated by Dr. Alberto González Fernández, with the participation of his colleagues from the Nodo Educativo Research Group, as well as the illustrator Francisco Kobo and the composers Nacho Márquez and Víctor Rodríguez. A project funded by the COTEC Foundation and developed by the Video Game Laboratory Nodo Play.

Anyone who enjoys the Napoleonic wars will find the tactical thinking required for Imperial Ambitions to be much more rewarding. As you forge an empire, the battlefields will become more challenging. We've redesigned the way that armies move on a campaign map, so they act more like real-world military units. Large armies move in column formation, making it harder to move and requires more tactical thinking to prepare for the battle. The regiments can be split from the main army for small tactical excursions, or sneak into enemy lines for crossfire. For the same reason, attention is required to avoid leaving gaps on your frontline.<br><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2219390/extras/UIs.png?t=1670527388" /><h2 class="bb_tag">Production Chains</h2><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2219390/extras/engineer.png?t=1670527388" />Your Empire will grow beyond the mountains and the seas. As it grows you will have access to more and endemic resources. The more you invest into your roads and docks, the more resources that produced around the corners of your empire will be transported into your capital. With abundance in your capital, you can allocate your laborers to produce to higher quality goods. Imperial Ambitions has more than 40 different resources that can be extracted, produced or imported. Your population will demand products depending on their level of education. You must manage your resources and customize your production chains, while ensuring the wellbeing of your population. Some key resources may just not be accessible to you. You can resolve either by leasing the land from the natives, military invasion, trading with superpowers, or exploiting black market.<br><br><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2219390/extras/Industry_in_IA_01-2-2.gif?t=1670527388" /><h2 class="bb_tag">Black Market And Trade</h2><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2219390/extras/merchant.png?t=1670527388" />For the savvy entrepreneur and economist, the black market is a huge opportunity to boost your own empire. No longer do you have to go through the tedious and sometimes costly process of building a colony and maintain an industry. the game will include a black market besides the regular market. In regular trade, a player can initiate a bid for something they need and, if another player sells it to them, everyone is happy! Though, this trade is also taxed by any country that has lands en route. Black market, however works completely different. The resources in the black market is pulled from towns with high corruption. And players can bid for these resources, even if they belong to their enemies. The cost, however, is often higher than normal, yet no one can tax. This can be a boon for some players in need of certain products that are capitalised by their enemies and for everyone that prefers not to pay taxes. Instead, however, corruption and criminal activity will become more prevalent among the towns along the route. e careful not to get caught in a cycle of corruption and crime! To promote corruption player can send man of shadows to start a crime syndicate. It however requires opium to initiate (also only available at black market) However, the player is not defenseless. Players can use the man of shadow to start intelligence mission, to eradicate crime syndicates.<br><br><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2219390/extras/social_classes_states.png?t=1670527388" /><h2 class="bb_tag">Social Classes</h2><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2219390/extras/artisan.png?t=1670527388" />The society in the game is divided into classes, slaves, peasants, apprentices, artisans and masters. Besides slaves, the citizens will be allowed to progress through four tiers of classes, with each step providing increased capabilities, but also requiring different resources from you. The education is the key for most of your citizens to climb this social ladder. Higher classes will provide exponentially more labor, but will also require unique luxury resources. The citizens may stop working for several reasons, such as training, hunger, epidemic, strike, accidents, criminal activities, exhaustion, rebellion or retirement. While higher classes are often preferable, they are also harder to maintain due to requirement of luxury. The units and agents are also required to be trained from respective classes. For that reason, the players need to find the optimal balance between these classes.<br><br><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2219390/extras/boats_in_IA_02.gif?t=1670527388" /><h2 class="bb_tag">Undisclosed Tech Tree</h2><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2219390/extras/spy.png?t=1670527388" />In our opinion, it is unrealistic for the players to be able to view the tech tree. In Imperial Ambitions, the player will only be shown the available techs they can fund without disclosing the whole tree. It makes the game more challenging and exciting. This is also part of the discovery experience in Imperial Ambitions - you learn by doing! Funding a tech is not enough for research. The player must have one of their gentlemen agent perform an action related to that technology to be able to discover it. This action is also not revealed to the player. Thus player has to make a guess to what actions would help discover that tech. For example, a gentlemen has to sail the ocean to be able to discover the &quot;Sextant&quot;, a navigation tool for sailors. Or, to discover &quot;Abolishment of slavery&quot; the player need to actually working slaves.<br><br><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2219390/extras/eventReportButtons.gif?t=1670527388" /><h2 class="bb_tag">Diplomacy</h2><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2219390/extras/diplomat.png?t=1670527388" />We envision a simple diplomacy for Imperial Ambitions. The difference in IA from most 4X, is that an agent has to be sent to the opponent's capital or party in an effort to ceasefire, establish trade relations, embassies, defensive pacts and alliances. Once an embassy or trade consulate is established the agent is dismissed. On the other hand, cancelling an existing agreement can simply be performed from the diplomacy window. It takes days to build bridges but seconds to destroy them.<br><br><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2219390/extras/gampley.png?t=1670527388" /><h2 class="bb_tag">Pixel Art Design</h2><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2219390/extras/janissary.png?t=1670527388" />We chose a pixelated art style for the game since it’s a fun and approachable way to communicate controversial events of our recent history such as post-colonial subversion. We also wanted a retro aesthetic design to assist players in imagining this alternate universe, mixing pop culture with classic cartoon representations of imperialism.

<GameName>Interregnum Chronicles: False Prophet</GameName>
<CONTENT>
Interregnum Chronicles: False Prophet is a tactical, turn-based strategy game about survival in a post-apocalyptic world of eternal winter.<br><br>An extraterrestrial mind-virus has struck the Earth, killing 95% of humanity while the poles have shifted and the world is plunged into a new ice age. Lead a group of survivors as the titular False Prophet to a promised land - a lie manufactured in a desperate bid to save your lost child. Find out if goals do justify the means, and what a desperate parent is willing to do to save their child.<br><br>This is the second entry in a series of games which tell the story of the Interregnum and its aftermath, based on the world created by Przemysław Karda.<h2 class="bb_tag">Gameplay</h2><strong>Fight</strong> for your life in turn-based tactical battles against desperate survivors like you. Use suppression and flanking to outsmart and outmaneuver your enemies. Experience a realistic depiction of a firefight in which suppression plays a key role.<br><br><strong>Survive</strong> the biting cold and ever-present hunger. Scavenge resources while trudging through frozen wastes of California. Loot, craft, and make the best of what you find. <br><br><strong>Explore</strong> alien anomalies and extraterrestrial phenomena that transcend human understanding. Alien civilizations fight over Earth with no regards to its human inhabitants. Their struggle is completely beyond human understanding as it warps the very structure of reality. <br><br><strong>Recruit</strong> survivors to your cause. The people you meet often have their own quests - how far will you go to convert them to your cause? The sick and the children are unable to work - will you leave them to die or make them part of your pilgrimage? <br><br><strong>Manage</strong> your caravan and the people that follow you. Their survival is in your hands, but if they lose faith they might just replace you. Launch expeditions to gather resources, divide the workforce, and guide your flock. The survival of the group will require sacrifices.<h2 class="bb_tag">Features</h2><strong>Tactical Combat</strong><br>Turn-based tactical combat with emphasis on realistic depiction of firefights. Suppression plays a key role as every shot drains the Action Points of its target and those nearby. Defeating enemies requires smart use of the fire and maneuver tactic. Your characters can have an array of special abilities that allow them to manipulate the battlefield - change turn order, transfer Action Points or mitigate the effects of suppression.<br><br><strong>Deep Survival Mechanics</strong><br>Managing warmth, hunger, and fatigue of your characters is as important as winning battles. Rationing food and deciding when and how to establish a campsite will be crucial to survival in the harsh environment of a post-apocalyptic winter. Choosing what your characters wear affects how fast they lose warmth, and must be balanced with gear that protects them in combat.<br><br><strong>Original Story</strong><br>The world of Interregnum is an original setting in which extraterrestrial beings are completely beyond any human. In this post-apocalyptic world, ordinary people are fighting for survival while the very structure of reality is being torn apart by a struggle beyond their understanding.

Has a cursed staff, she has vowed to never touch another human. However, her destiny is precariously set in motion by the visit of three courageously knights.<br><br>She is feared as a witch. All who approach her are said to meet their end. <br>Some say she can control the very elements themselves.<br>Others say she has the power to summon creatures from the darkest depths of the underworld.<br><br>No one knows for sure what she is capable of.<br>But all agree that it would be best not to cross her.<br>But there is a trace of the ordinary girl she used to be in the way she loves to make snowmen. Maybe somewhere deep down, she still yearns for the happy childhood she once had.<br>The engraving on her body is proof that she is the owner of a cursed relic.<br>The relic is what makes her loneliness, but deep down she knows it is a part of her. Without it, she would be lost. It is her strength and also her weakness.<br>The eyes looking into the distance seem to be searching for someone she should avenge. Perhaps that is what brought her out for this journey. Her quest is clear to her, even if no one else understands. <br>She is looking for the person who took everything from her and destroyed her life.<br><br><br><strong>Magic Combat</strong><br>-Ice Spike<br>A huge ice spikes suddenly protrude from the ground, inflicting intense physical damage on the enemy.<br><br>-Ice Lance<br>&quot;Just get in line.&quot;<br>A spear of ice pierces through a swarm of enemies. The ice quickly spreads through their bodies, inflicting physical damage.<br><br>-Vortex<br>The vortex lifts the enemy into the air and deals magic damage. Smaller enemies are helpless against this assault, but larger ones cannot be hoisted up by the vortex. Consequently, they are only damaged by the magic, not lifted into the air.<br><br>-Blizzard<br>This ability deploys a localized snowstorm at the target location. The storm lasts for a certain amount of time and inflicts continuous magical damage to enemies who step into it. This makes it a great way to deal damage to multiple enemies at once and can be very helpful in crowded areas.<br><br>-Frost Breath<br>Exhale a breath of frost. It inflicts freezing damage to enemies caught in it. Enemies who stay in it for too long are frozen. It is powerful but has a short range.<br><br>-Chilling Aura<br>A  spell of ultra-low temperature, creating an aura of freezing cold.  She can maintain the aura for a certain period of time, dealing freezing damage to any enemies who enter it. Any creature who touches it for a long time is frozen .<br><br>-Rush<br>The ability to travel short distances instantly by concentrating magic power is a skill that takes much practice to master, but helps to avoid danger. The more proficient wizards can travel longer distances for extended periods of time, but they use up more Mana. This is why it's easy to imagine that high-level wizards are able to travel great distances very quickly.<br><br>-Ice Golem<br>It was an accident. The witch, who used to make snowmen by hand, tried to create them with her magical powers and an ice doll was born. Since then it has been a reassuring companion who supports her long spell chanting.<br><br>-Ice Wall<br>Sturdiness is key when it comes to defending yourself. So a little ingenuity on the ice spikes is essential to keeping those pesky enemies at bay. Walls that emit cold air can freeze nearby enemies, but they don't seem to cause any damage. However, the frigid temperature is enough to made them extremely uncomfortable.<br><br>-Spell Chain<br>You will be caught off guard if you think chanting is the only way to release your magic.  there are many other ways to release your magic. Chanting is just one method. This snow witch seems to be particularly good at planting the next spell in the one she has unleashed. It's as if she has a special talent for it. The snow witch is always one step ahead, and her opponents never know what's coming next.<br><br>-Spell Combo<br>One relatively easy way to push one's limits is to exalt. One example is the battle cry uttered by warriors.<br>The rhythmic spell releasing will give her pleasure.

The Children's Friendは、ポイント＆クリック形式の自動生成アドベンチャーです。<br />
新人サンタクロースとなった貴方は、上司ニコラウスの指示でクリスマスの配達に出発します。<br />
トナカイ「ヴァンデアッグ」の導きで精神のトンネルをくぐり、落っこちた先は「子供の夢の中」。<br />
寝ている子供の魂を探し、プレゼントを枕元に置いて去れば、お仕事は達成。<br />
ニコラウスからサラリーを貰えるでしょう。<br />
<br />
でも、貴方も、きっと迷ったことありますよね？<br />
プレゼントって、何をあげるのがいいのでしょうか？<br />
<br />
ニコラウスから受け取った、「シン・ニコラウスの書」によれば……<br />
良い子なら嬉しいものを、悪い子にはチェーンソー（の刃のできるだけ先端の尖っている部分を、できるだけ速度が出ている状態で）をプレゼントしなければならないとあります。<br />
<br />
子供の夢の中を見て回り、その子が世の中にとって役に立つ良い子なのか、調和と信仰を乱す悪い子なのか、きちんと大人の判断をしてあげることが大切です。<br />
夢の中に入っていられる時間は、PM 11:00 から、AM 00:00 までの 1 時間。<br />
夢の中を徘徊する家畜やペット、父親や母親といった、邪魔で汚れたニコラウス的にあまり良くない存在も、注意しなければいけません。<br />
時にはそれらがヒントになることもあるかもしれませんが……。<br />
<br />
ニコラウスから与えられたノルマは 5 人への配送。<br />
これを達成して来年からは高級サンタとして活躍するか、<br />
はたまた、きついことで有名なニコラウスのお仕置きを食らってしまうのか、<br />
<br />
すべては貴方次第です。

Every early December another kid from your school goes missing, and rumors on the playground have circulated that it's related to Krampusnacht- the night that a half-goat half-demon named Krampus comes and steals away naughty children and spares the good. But what is it that determines if people are taken by Krampus?<br><br>For Goodness Sake is a very <strong>short horror text heavy game</strong>, focusing on several trolley problem situations. While completing the chores around the house, you find yourself reflecting on situations involving the neighborhood kids that have gone missing &amp; ultimately deciding what you think might have been the right thing to do. <strong>Will you be taken by Krampus at the end of the night like the others, or will you be spared?</strong><br><br><ul class="bb_ul"><li> Playtime: 15-20 minutes.<br></li><li> 3D first person navigation<br></li><li> Ending depends on your answers given<br></li><li> Rich audio design and atmosphere</li></ul><br><br><br>Created in one month, for the HauntedPS1 community's Madvent Calendar 2022 project.<br><br>This was created as a small mental break from DEAD LETTER DEPT, an atmospheric typing horror game currently in development.<br><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1627350/Dead_Letter_Dept/?utm_source=ForGoodnessSakeSteamPage" target="_blank" rel=""  id="dynamiclink_0" >https://store.steampowered.com/app/1627350/Dead_Letter_Dept/?utm_source=ForGoodnessSakeSteamPage</a> 8 user reviewsAs Christmas is just 2 weeks away [i]For Goodness Sake[/i] is the perfect game to play now. You control a kid who decides to do some household chores before going to sleep while other family members are asleep. The order of completion doesn't matter - the objective is to make a decision every time he completes a chore as he remembers something. Something that happened at school be it bullying or stealing or lying. The stories are all connected with children disappearing.
 
As we remember we have the opportunity to reflect and assess the situation. What happened, who was at fault and what should have been done. These decisions will eventually determine our fate with Krampus. Are we naughty or we do not deserve to be punished?

This is one of those games with simplistic graphics that one may consider too simplistic - outright ugly, actually. The filter used here is meant to hide this and instead there is greater focus on the atmospheric gameplay with particular emphasis on the sound design. Due to it being dark I had issues with the filter but I appreciated the well-placed light sources. This is a surprisingly fun, short game I can only recommend!https://youtu.be/KhDhPtx6V-o

<GameName>DepthViewer</GameName>
<CONTENT>
Creates 3D VR scenes from 2D input using depth estimation machine learning model.<br />
<br />
Takes any images or videos, estimates the depth using MiDaS model, and draws it in the 3D space for your VR HMD! <br />
You can save the depthmap output to use it later, record a 3D VR video to upload on Youtube. This program also can fetch the screen of your desktop and show the depth. 3 user reviews[h1]Experienced on the Meta Quest 2[/h1]

You can view my review & gameplay here: https://youtu.be/3-XrHTP2KxQ

This app is not perfect. It will not render every single 2D / pancake photo or video into perfect 3D for viewing in VR. However, when it works well, it works really well. Sometimes it looked like the photo or video was native stereoscopic 3D of high quality. Other times, not so much.

I think the key thing is that the photo needs to have some natural depth to it, even if it's in 2D. The photo or video also should be of high quality (4k or higher resolution recommended) and the lighting and sharpness should be good overall. The part you want in 3D should be in focus on the photo or video. 

Anyways, you can check out my video where I test several different photos and videos using the app. Overall, I was impressed by how good the quality was, although you'll also see several times where it didn't work so well. This app is free to play so I can easily recommend it. Please note though: motion controllers are not currently supported. You'll have to use mouse and keyboard. Also note: it initially renders to your desktop only. From there, you'll have to choose a source of where the supported video / photo formats are located. I used mostly mp4s and jpgs and they worked fine.

This app is not perfect. It will not render every single 2D / pancake photo or video into perfect 3D for viewing in VR. However, when it works well, it works really well. Sometimes it looked like the photo or video was native stereoscopic 3D of high quality. Other times, not so much.

I think the key thing is that the photo needs to have some natural depth to it, even if it's in 2D. The photo or video also should be of high quality (4k or higher resolution recommended) and the lighting and sharpness should be good overall. The part you want in 3D should be in focus on the photo or video.

Digital Eclipse Arcade: Invasion of the Buffet Snatchers is the latest in a series of all-new games inspired by classic '80s arcade vibes.<br><br>The ravenous Buffetlians from the planet Divowrr travel the galaxy in search of savory delights — and they've finally set their sights on Earth! But instead of eating the populace, they're curious to participate in the exotic culinary ritual they assume was named for them: &quot;the buffet.&quot; Attracted to the bright lights of Las Vegas but lacking the social graces (and opposable thumbs) of the local populace, the Buffetlians expect to be served immediately upon their arrival — and if they don't get the food they crave, they'll start snacking straight from the buffet itself!

[h1]Synopsis[/h1]
Sex Adventures - Cuckold Gym is a railroad visual novel.

[h1]Story[/h1]
Daniel is a trainer at a gym and Amber is one of his favorite clients. She is one of the hottest girls he's ever had the pleasure of training. She's hot, confident and always flirting with him. The problem is she has a boyfriend. One night Amber comes in for her session and it is just Daniel and her in the gym. Things take a turn as Amber's boyfriend Travis walks in while Amber is working her glutes as Daniel supervises.

[h1]Gameplay[/h1]
The story is told from an omnipotent point of view, you know the thoughts of all of the characters. The text in general isn't bad, there are a few typos and poor word selections, using bread instead of bead for instance.

The "chapters" are basically different scenes or location changes. After each chapter you have the option of replaying the scene or continuing the story. As you advance in the story you are given the option to watch the movie of the scene.

The title is a bit misleading as I wouldn't call this a cuckold story. Yes, Daniel does do the girl, but under Travis' supervision and only after Travis humiliates Daniel making him watch.

[h1]The Gallery[/h1]
There are two Galleries, an image gallery with 55 images, basically every image in the game, and a video gallery that is unlocked by finishing the game. In order to access the video gallery you will need to save the game at the end, it cannot be accessed from the main menu.

[h1]Final Verdict[/h1]
I don't consider it to be a Cuckold story. The images are fine. There are some issues with the text, mostly the wrong word used. If you enjoy other Erotic Games Club games you'll probably like this one.

[h1]Synopsis[/h1]
Hentai Nurse is a Unity is a swapper puzzle game. You pick a piece and drag it where you want it and when you drop it, the piece that was there moves to where the piece came from.

[h1]Gameplay[/h1]
The game starts off easy with a six piece puzzle and the puzzles increase in complexity as you progress. There is no real logic behind the number of pieces, as they will increase and decrease as you progress. When the puzzle appears you get a brief glimpse of what the finished puzzle is supposed to look like. There are only a couple of the later puzzles that have similar color pieces that you may need to swap to complete. There are 24 images in total that increase in lewdness as the puzzles progress.

[h1]The Gallery[/h1]
There is no Gallery, however you can cycle through the puzzles you have completed to see the images again.

[h1]Final Verdict[/h1]
Hentai Nurse, like the other Hentai works games on Steam, is an inexpensive puzzle game with good art.

场景：这是在大陆上，一开始是在王城，一开始是在王座之间，就是国王的位置，会有侍从-小兵，再往下走是王城大厅，这里有不少人了，每个人都有文本。出去是城下町，冒险就开始了，是全彩世界。<br />
战斗系统：回合制战斗系统，有普通攻击，咒文，道具（草药），和逃跑，完全DQ模式，让你沉浸在勇者斗恶龙模拟世界，，攻击先后是随机的，攻击防御都和购买的装备有关联。咒文有攻击咒文和恢复咒文，运用了战斗特效和粒子系统，使得很漂亮，和NDS勇者斗恶龙匹敌一下可以。<br />
音乐：成本很大，游戏不大，音乐媲美勇者我觉得。<br />
细节：为了使玩家玩得流畅，我取消了升级打怪，简化金钱，使得玩家能顺利过关，要有很多耐心游玩。

As a conscience, you have the opportunity to follow everything the main character does and goes through. You get a glimpse into his hidden memories that put him on this wicked path. However, you don't have the ability to manipulate him because there is an even more mysterious entity with you that is the main instigator, controlling behavior, lusts, and the desire to hurt. <br><br>You are exposed to many interpretations of his worldview, both external and internal, his struggle with himself, and it is up to you to help him. If you manage to weaken his inner will enough, you may end his story much sooner than you think. Or you can walk all the way to the end, learning the whole story through his memories, but at a terrible cost. You are in for a surreal journey through the subconscious, the inner demons and the bitter realities of the world. <br><br>It is important to note that this is still a beta demo.

[h1]Synopsis[/h1]
Emma in the Library is a RenPy literary quiz visual novel.

[h1]Story[/h1]
You wake up after a night of drunken sex to find that the woman you were with has taken your books, wallet, laptop, and phone. The sex was good, but it wasn't that good. She will return your things in exchange for you writing her term paper for her…by tomorrow. Good thing you're great at writing paper.  You head to the library to use one of their computers and to research the paper.

None of the books on the list she gave you are available in the library. Fortunately a search on line reveals a nearby library where you can at least get one of the books. You drive the half hour to get the book you need. There you meet Emma.

[h1]Gameplay[/h1]
You start of by entering your name. You go to the library and meet Emma. Next you spend the week selecting what you want to do with your time. You have two papers to write and you need to study for Emma's test. When you study for Emma's test it gives you a free pass on a question. You can also check your phone as Emma keeps sending you pictures trying to figure out what's she's going to wear for your test. Emma also hid some pictures in your bag. There is sufficient time to write both papers and study each of the test areas once. However, to get the Happy Ending you'll have to forego  studying for Emma's test.

On the day of the test you will return to the library. The test is 24 questions, three in each subject, from a pool of questions. There is no time limit on the questions, so you can search the web to find the answers if you don't know them. Odds are unless you possess a degree in literature you won't know enough answers.  If you studied you can use one of your study points to answer the question. If you roll back or reload a save it will affect your score. The only way to get a perfect score is to answer the questions correctly.

[h1]The Gallery[/h1]
There are three different Galleries where you can view content that you have unlocked from the game. There is the Images gallery with 81 images. The Video gallery with 15 videos. Most of the videos are paired, one early act and one later in the act. Finally there is the Replay gallery with 6 scene replays, just like they were in the game.

TL;DR : This game grades out at an A on the A-F scale. Read further for more details.

Emma in the Library is a short adult VN with a literary twist.

Graphically speaking, it's done in the style of the CGI renders which have become increasingly popular over the past five years. There's not a ton of variety, since the only girl you're actually interacting with is the titular (immature giggle) Emma. That being said, if you like the “naughty librarian” look, and are into blondes, she's very easy on the eyes. The sound is nothing to write home about, but given how short the game is, it's hard to really penalize the VN for this. It features all the standard QOL stuff you expect in a modern VN – auto skipping text you've already seen, a gallery option, etc. It does all the things it should, and it does them competently.

Where it gets creative is HOW you reach the various endings and scenes. The first part of the game features a bit of time management, where you have to decide whether to do college coursework, or study for Emma's exam. You naturally want to do good in school, since it's college, but you also want to do well on Emma's personal quiz, because, well..SEX. This section is extremely brief, because the dev realizes you're much more interested in getting to the adult portion of the game, and soon enough, you're taking a 24 question quiz on various genres of literature. Studying for her quiz will give you the ability to automatically answer her question, assuming you have “study points” in whatever genre she's asking about. However, you're also able to use google to get your answers, so HA HA. (And really, taking shortcuts on exams is part of the college experience, isn't it?)

Depending on how well you do, you'll get a different outcome. Do poorly, and she's not even going to be fully naked. Do well, and you're getting more the bonus plan on your encounter. No spoilers here, but the ending may not be what you're expecting.

A full run through the game is approximately a half hour, assuming you don't skip text, so the game is very short, even by adult game standards. However, there's definitely some replay to be had here. (You're not likely to get her bonus questions correct on the first run without a guide.) You're still likely to have seen everything there is to see in roughly two hours at most, and it's unlikely to be something you'll revisit once you're done. Price is definitely a factor here though, and even at full price, it's only $5 USD. It's completely worth it for this experience, and doubly so if you find it on sale. This one gets an A rating without any reservations.See kids, this is why you should study real hard.[h1]Too Long Didn't Read Version[/h1]

[h1]Synopsis[/h1]
Emma in the Library is a RenPy literary quiz visual novel.

[h1]Story[/h1]
You wake up after a night of drunken sex to find that the woman you were with has taken your books, wallet, laptop, and phone. The sex was good, but it wasn't that good. She will return your things in exchange for you writing her term paper for her…by tomorrow. Good thing you're great at writing paper.  You head to the library to use one of their computers and to research the paper.

None of the books on the list she gave you are available in the library. Fortunately a search on line reveals a nearby library where you can at least get one of the books. You drive the half hour to get the book you need. There you meet Emma.

[h1]Gameplay[/h1]
You start of by entering your name. You go to the library and meet Emma. Next you spend the week selecting what you want to do with your time. You have two papers to write and you need to study for Emma's test. When you study for Emma's test it gives you a free pass on a question. You can also check your phone as Emma keeps sending you pictures trying to figure out what's she's going to wear for your test. Emma also hid some pictures in your bag. There is sufficient time to write both papers and study each of the test areas once. However, to get the Happy Ending you'll have to forego  studying for Emma's test.

On the day of the test you will return to the library. The test is 24 questions, three in each subject, from a pool of questions. There is no time limit on the questions, so you can search the web to find the answers if you don't know them. Odds are unless you possess a degree in literature you won't know enough answers.  If you studied you can use one of your study points to answer the question. If you roll back or reload a save it will affect your score. The only way to get a perfect score is to answer the questions correctly.

[h1]The Gallery[/h1]
There are three different Galleries where you can view content that you have unlocked from the game. There is the Images gallery with 81 images. The Video gallery with 15 videos. Most of the videos are paired, one early act and one later in the act. Finally there is the Replay gallery with 6 scene replays, just like they were in the game. 

[h1]Final Verdict[/h1]
AceX is a a developer to watch. Emma - In the Library is another game from Ace X with a high quality beautiful girl. There is just one, but she's worth it. Plus you may actually learn something about literature.

<CONTENT>
This is a casual game of finding differences + goddess CG. There are two pictures on the left and right in each level. On the right side of the level interface, there is a hint that how many differences between the two pictures and how many differences have been found. Click on the different points in any picture, and a green circle appears to indicate that the correct search has been made. If there is a difference, an error symbol indicates that it is incorrect. Find all the differences within the time limit to complete the level tasks. It's very difficult, it's really boring! 1 user reviewsI own several different puzzle games for my computer but I didn't have any games like this yet. I can usually spot several of the differences really quickly but there are usually one or two I have difficulty finding, and then there is a time limit. There are only 10 puzzles in this game. Some people may lose interest in the game after just beating all the puzzles one time, but people with a bad memory can enjoy playing it several times.I own several different puzzle games for my computer but I didn't have any games like this yet.

<h2 class="bb_tag">Story Background</h2>We travel through the universe to collect precious treasures. During our journey we enjoy the magnificent scenery of the universe, we will also encounter different enemies, we will create black holes and devour our enemies.<h2 class="bb_tag">Gameplay</h2>It is a relaxing game where when you choose two targets of the same color, they are connected by lightning and then destroyed by a black hole. When you destroy 100 targets, you win. <br><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2214860/extras/GIFyanshi.gif?t=1669270258" /><br>Of course, you have to finish within the allotted time to win, each game is limited to 5 minutes, and the shorter the time, the higher the rating you get. As I said, it's a simple little game to decompress.<br><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2214860/extras/GIF11.11.gif?t=1669270258" /><h2 class="bb_tag">Game Features</h2>To make the game more interesting, I made the game into 3D graphics. Unlike traditional 2D graphics, you can control your character to fly freely in the universe without being restricted. You'll need to keep connecting more targets during your flight, and you'll soon find it fun.<h2 class="bb_tag">More Game Modes</h2>Obstacle Mode: Add a random number of objects that are the same size and color as the target, but selecting them will not react in any way.<br><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2214860/extras/11.21GIF.gif?t=1669270258" /><br>Gem Mode: Eliminate 100 targets while collecting a randomly specified number of gems to win.<br><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2214860/extras/11.21GIF_1_.gif?t=1669270258" /><br>Vanishing Mode: Targets disappear randomly, making it difficult to lock onto them when there are fewer and fewer targets.<br><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2214860/extras/11.21GIF_2_.gif?t=1669270258" /><br>These game modes interfere with quick target selection, and it's not easy to beat a perfect score.<h2 class="bb_tag">More Fun</h2>As you win more and more, new maps are unlocked for you. In the new map, bosses will be spawned with different skills that will attack you at any time. You'll need to dodge boss skills in time, because if you get hit, your character will die instantly and you'll need to challenge again.<br><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2214860/extras/GIF.gif?t=1669270258" /><br><br>There are currently 4 maps in the game and 800 levels waiting for you to unlock.<h2 class="bb_tag">The Developers Want to Say</h2>This is my first indie game and I hope to make it even better. So I hope that players will be able to comment on this game after the experience, and I will do my best to improve it.<h2 class="bb_tag">You Can Contact Me</h2><h2 class="bb_tag">QQ：690845098</h2>

Psychological horror in which you will experience the true experience of fear.

No wanderer left behind.<br>Realistic graphics, minimal user interfaces, and dreary ambience will ensure an immersive horror experience.<br><br><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2215050/extras/shouting.gif?t=1669319566" /><br><br>You will have to work together in order to escape from that nightmare as fast as possible.<br><br>If you’re not careful and you noclip out of reality in the wrong areas you’ll end up in the Backrooms, where it’s nothing but the stink of old moist carpet, the madness of mono-yellow, the endless background noise of fluorescent lights at maximum hum-buzz, and approximately six hundred million square miles of randomly segmented empty rooms to be trapped in. God save you if you hear something wandering around nearby, because it sure as hell has heard you.<br><br><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2215050/extras/sitting.gif?t=1669319566" /><br><br>Level 0 is an expansive non-Euclidean space, resembling the back rooms of a retail outlet. All rooms in Level 0 share the same superficial features, such as worn mono-yellow wallpaper, old moist carpet, scattered electrical outlets, and inconsistently-placed fluorescent lighting. Aside from these common features, no two rooms within the level are identical.<br><strong>It's almost as if the level existed to spite one's sense of reality.</strong><br><br>The fluorescent lighting present in Level 0 hums at a constant frequency. This buzzing is notably louder and more obtrusive than ordinary fluorescent lights, and examination of the fixtures to determine the source has been inconclusive thus far. Secondly, the substance lightly saturating the carpet cannot be consistently identified; it is not water, nor is it safe to consume.

Falling from a height kills player.<h2 class="bb_tag">Features:</h2>- 9 levels<br>- Skeleton character<br>- Puzzles<br>- Falling damage<br>- Steam achievements 2 user reviewsI don't know. Some levels were good to play and then there were some levels where I just wanted to punch this game back into unity asset store.

Levels with obstacles (especially those Karate Kid practice things) are annoying as hell. In one level they just push you off (at least for me) but you have to use them to platform and reach the next stage. Wasn't fun at all and kinda destroyed my positive opinion from the first few levels.

Fall damage is kinda  random as well (it seems). I sometimes died by falling a small distance while other times I could fall for ages and survive.

Wall-Jumping, oh man. I don't know, it also felt like random. Often times the character would stop jumping from the wall and just fall/slide down. Its really not that hard to press the jump button, so I certainly won't take the blame for having issues with it.. :D


The puzzle are ok, nothing to crazy which is good considering I hate puzzle games.



I mentioned more negative stuff but those are like 2-3 levels out of 9 (so far) which overshadowed my experience but overall its not a terrible bugged games like (Nash Racing).I don't know.

To roll to the designated panel, you need to make sure that the eyes on the panel are the same as the eyes on your top, but you change the eyes every time you roll. So, even if you roll honestly, it may not work. When that happens, I recommend that you start over, choose a different puzzle, or get away from &quot;Suikoro&quot; and play another game, or go outside and change your mind.<br><br><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2214480/extras/explanation_image_2.png?t=1668567575" /><br><br>■Change your colors and change your mood!<br>Are your colors white, black and red?

Tsubaki Hata is an asset flip, what Valve calls a "fake game".  The "developer", Unreal Quality Games/Rosa Special Studio, took the [url=https://github.com/Shit-Just-Got-Real-Studios/Jigsaw]Jigsaw[/url] Unity game template/demo from the real developers, Sh*t-Just-Got-Real Studios, changed the name and added a couple (about 3) stock/low effort images of "anime girls", and dumped the result onto Steam.  They're attempting to scam people into buying this, so they can get your money for someone else's work.

It gets worse... the Jigsaw Github template has been shamelessly dumped on Steam by Rosa Special Studio a whopping 64 times.  That's got to be a world record for the most asset flip scams from the same template.  Here's some of them so you can see for yourself:

Take a look... these are all [i]exactly the same game![/i]

"Jigsaw" is just a free Github jigsaw template for Unity mobile apps, and doesn't have any merit as a proper, fully fledged PC game, so this lame copy of that template is impossible to recommend.

Asset flips don't involve any professional game development.  All Rosa Special Studio does here is change the puzzle images and then dump the exact same game with different images onto Steam as a cash grab.  Asset flips like this are harmful to the gaming industry and to Steam because they reduce the visibility that sincerely made indie games should have, and make it harder for gamers to find real games from genuine developers.

Don't reward this morally bankrupt, unethical behaviour from Unreal Quality Games/Rosa Special Studio.

Take a look... these are all [i]exactly the same game![/i]

"Jigsaw" is just a free Github jigsaw template for Unity mobile apps, and doesn't have any merit as a proper, fully fledged PC game, so this lame copy of that template is impossible to recommend.

Asset flips don't involve any professional game development.  All Rosa Special Studio does here is change the puzzle images and then dump the exact same game with different images onto Steam as a cash grab.  Asset flips like this are harmful to the gaming industry and to Steam because they reduce the visibility that sincerely made indie games should have, and make it harder for gamers to find real games from genuine developers.

Don't reward this morally bankrupt, unethical behaviour from Unreal Quality Games/Rosa Special Studio.

Pichi Girl is an asset flip, what Valve calls a "fake game".  The "developer", Rosa Special Studio/Unreal Quality Games, took the [url=https://github.com/Shit-Just-Got-Real-Studios/Jigsaw]Jigsaw[/url] Unity game template/demo from the real developers, Sh*t-Just-Got-Real Studios, changed the name and added a couple (about 3) stock/low effort images of "anime girls", and dumped the result onto Steam.  They're attempting to scam people into buying this, so they can get your money for someone else's work.

It gets worse... the Jigsaw Github template has been shamelessly dumped on Steam by Rosa Special Studio a whopping 64 times.  That's got to be a world record for the most asset flip scams from the same template.  Here's some of them so you can see for yourself:

This is a pretty good quality jigsaw puzzle game at a low price, but there are only five puzzles which is less than some of my other games. A couple of the pictures are really attractive. There are features like allowing you to separate the edge pieces from the other pieces.[quote][url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asset_flip]Warning: Asset Flip![/url][/quote]

Take a look... these are all [i]exactly the same game![/i]

"Jigsaw" is just a free Github jigsaw template for Unity mobile apps, and doesn't have any merit as a proper, fully fledged PC game, so this lame copy of that template is impossible to recommend.

Asset flips don't involve any professional game development.  All Rosa Special Studio does here is change the puzzle images and then dump the exact same game with different images onto Steam as a cash grab.  Asset flips like this are harmful to the gaming industry and to Steam because they reduce the visibility that sincerely made indie games should have, and make it harder for gamers to find real games from genuine developers.

Don't reward this morally bankrupt, unethical behaviour from Rosa Special Studio/Unreal Quality Games.
This is a pretty good quality jigsaw puzzle game at a low price, but there are only five puzzles which is less than some of my other games. A couple of the pictures are really attractive. There are features like allowing you to separate the edge pieces from the other pieces.

The Blight has heightened vision and can see well in dark places along with incredible strength that allows it to snap the neck of any employee in an instant.

<CONTENT>
Explore the abandoned Asher Asylum in an effort to find a missing cop.  Learn about the horrors plaguing the old asylum, and try to find a way to stop its cursed residents from leaving.  <br />
This indie horror FPS is designed as a throw-back to the late 2000s indie horror scene, complete with collectibles, pages of lore, inventory management, clunky combat, and multiple endings, all intended to capture the glory days of internet horror games, both the good parts and the bad parts. 1 user reviewsI played this game for about 2 hours today and I love it. The atmosphere is great, it has great jump scares, good mechanics and a good inventory system. Enemies will clip through doors sometimes but they're easy to run from and lose interest after you get a certain distance away. I would definitely recommend this game for anyone that loves horror games and can't wait to get back to it tomorrow.

*Edit*

Holy crap this game is GOOD. I played more of it today as well as his other 2 he recommends and man has he come a long way. I got the hidden ending completely by accident and will most definitely try to get all the others tomorrow or the next day.

<GameName>Prehistoric World: A New Beginning</GameName>
<CONTENT>
Prehistoric World: A New Beginning is a strategy game set in an open world. As a representative of a private company, you have been given the task of building a complete, functional dinosaur fauna on a newly discovered planet while maximizing your company's profits. You have more than 42 species of dinosaurs to choose from - herbivores, predators, pterosaurs, aquatic dinosaurs.  You have access to many locations on the planet where you can try to revive the Jurassic era. <br><br>You can organize expeditions and hunts for profit, or you can solve situations by landing on the planet yourself. Technology also allows you to control the brain of any dinosaur you have on the planet. You can also breed dinosaurs, sell their eggs, and perform a variety of tasks. There is also a native alien fauna on the planet that you must suppress.<br><br><br><br><strong>STORY</strong><br>66 million years ago, a 15-kilometre asteroid, Chicxulub, crashed into Earth.  The impact of the trillion-ton meteorite was enormously powerful and caused a worldwide ecological disaster. This catastrophe caused the last known mass extinction at the turn of the Mesozoic Era and ended the dominance of the dinosaurs. The impact created a crater 80 kilometres wide and 30 kilometres deep. The impact released enormous energy, resulting in fires, earthquakes and megatsunamis. The worst effects of the impact lasted 30 years. The impact winter that followed the impact lasted more than a century. The entire planet was affected. The disaster wiped out 75 percent of life on Earth.<br><br>By 2190, scientists had deciphered the dinosaurs' DNA and learned to reconstruct it. In 2220, the technology of traveling at the speed of light was discovered and successfully tested.  The exploration and settlement of planets beyond our solar system began.<br><br>In 2362, a private company, ACTAS, found a planet that is 85% similar to our earth from 66 million years ago. The planet was named Hope. The company decided to reconstruct the dinosaur fauna and use it for commercial purposes. The entire planet was declared a protected reserve. Only paying visitors are allowed on the planet. Some private companies have not recognised this move by ACTAS. The company expects huge profits from this unique attraction.<br><br>The first step was to build a space station in the orbit of Hope. Samples of several dozen dinosaurs were brought to the station. The entire planet has been fairly well mapped. Locations were selected for dinosaur settlement where there is less of an abundance of alien species inhabiting the planet. The company has appointed you director of the planetary colonization project. Your task is to build a functional and harmonious fauna on the planet and maximize the company's profits. And here begins your new adventure!

Have not completed entire game, but I am trying to make sure I find all the coins on each level before continuing on.  Levels grow in difficulty and length.  With the programmable robot having a slight difference in each run, your programming decisions become more and more important for the first several lines of codes as those make a huge change by the end of the level.  Not a game I thought I would enjoy, but have found myself playing it all the time when I'm just sitting at the desk.  I really enjoy the way the scenery changes as the levels progress.  Will update as I complete the remaining levels.

Introduction to the game:<br>AOI is a 2d horizontal board platform jumping game similar to the Galaxy Warrior Demon City. You will play the little girl AOI to explore a fantastic world,<br>AOI wakes up from sleep and loses her memory. As the game goes on, her memory will be gradually awakened and the truth of the world will emerge.<br><br><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2212390/extras/attac.png?t=1669951134" /><br><br>- This is a single player adventure game, requiring players to jump, fight, and a little decryption.<br><br>- The game process of this work has a certain degree of freedom, mainly in the following two aspects:<br>     *The game maps are connected, and players can select the attack sequence of the map area to a certain extent.<br>     *Players can pass through the game in the initial state, or win gold coins by defeating the enemy, and then go to the store to buy powerful weapons, energy stones and other ways to improve themselves, and then challenge the boss. Players can decide according to their own preferences.<br><br>- The game has challenging levels and Boss battles.<br><br>- Players can carry 3 kinds of weapons at the same time. The attack means of each weapon are completely different, and they can switch instantaneously, so that players can achieve their unique fighting style and freely combine their fighting skills.<br><br>- There is almost no mandatory plot animation in the game. Players who only like jumping and fighting can completely ignore the plot. Players who like the plot can also explore the plot of the game through NPC dialogues and scattered information.<br><br>The game supports the key modification of the handle and keyboard, and has made the corresponding UI prompt adaptation. Players can set according to their own habits. Players can simply use ordinary attack clearance games. You can also choose to match different weapons to achieve the combination of skills, or grasp the opportunity to fight with the enemy to make yourself invincible. In short, the game design concept is to give players enough freedom to choose their own way to experience this wonderful journey.

<GameName>Full Gear</GameName>
<CONTENT>
<i>Songs of steam and bright machines...</i><br><br><strong>Welcome to Full Gear! </strong>This steampunk-style traditional roguelike is all about information: learn new things, die from an unknown attack, repeat. Use goggles, guns and gadgets to get a gain on the gears, and find... whatever you're looking for down there. You keep forgetting your goal, don't you Devi? Eyes on the prize!<br>With more than 200 unique items to equip, throw, shoot, learn and lose, there's plenty of possibilities to crash your wrench into the drones patrolling the area. And sometimes your own drones as well. Featuring:<br><ul class="bb_ul"><li>8 sprawling areas, all in one giant room, to traverse</li><li>48 unique enemies, completely animated in cute pixel art style</li><li>6 NPC's with their own hopes, dreams, aspirations, and make-shift shops</li><li>9 Boosts and 9 Challenges to make the game harder - or easier - at will</li><li>6 main bosses and 1 final boss</li><li>28 Steam achievements!</li></ul><h2 class="bb_tag">Make Your Own Death Machines</h2>Ah, but using a weapon is never quite enough, is it? You need additional firepower! Gather Parts and combine them in any way you like using local Drone Stations, then let the crafted <strong>Drones </strong>roam near you, distracting and eliminating any threat. You can make a killer robot with three flamethrowers moving at lightning speed - or a cute companion with a taser called Randy. Nobody's safe from Randy. <br><br><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2212500/extras/gif4.gif?t=1669725842" /><h2 class="bb_tag">A Turn Of Events</h2>That cogwheel of yours isn't just for decoration, it's your essence. Whenever a <strong>Token </strong>reaches the top, it'll activate whatever it does - heal you, shield you, give a Crit, give Scrap, or allow a Drone to fire. Re-arrange these Wheel Tokens to whatever you see fit, and before you can say &quot;hey watch this&quot; you deal 40 damage in one attack.<br>Not enough slots for your tokens to fit? No big deal! Swap <strong>cogwheels </strong>to get more slots, stacked slots, special tokens or more regeneration to increase your active capacity. But beware - larger cogwheels may have more slots, but consequently, each slot activate less often.<br><br><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2212500/extras/gif1A.gif?t=1669725842" /><h2 class="bb_tag">Block And Unlock</h2>Many items are locked at first, but in-game <strong>Goals </strong>can be tracked to unlock them. How do you get 5 Curse? Deal 30 damage? Use a Reclaimer? The items you gain from completing goals interact with those mechanics heavily! Additionally, you can simply choose Traditional Mode, where all items are unlocked from the start and Goals are purely cosmetic. Excellent for those living the rogue-life.<br><br><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2212500/extras/gif2A.gif?t=1669725842" /><h2 class="bb_tag">Remembered History</h2>You aren't alone. Maybe that's for the best.<br><br><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2212500/extras/gif3.gif?t=1669725842" /><br><br>There's people down here. Actual people, Devi. Maybe they have some information. You'll need every bit of it.<br>They have stories to tell? About mechanics? Good. About the lore? Hm, is that interesting?<br>Are they of use? They clearly have things they can give you. Maybe it's worth your time after all.<br><br>Getting them out of this place?<br>What, are you insane?<br><br><strong><i>See you around.</i></strong>

Barbelé is an Action and 3D Fighting, 3rd person game. It's a story driven adventure in a french prison which offers players dialogue choices.<br />
You will have to do your time in prison, survive in a penitentiary with a real in game timer that you can influence with your action. You can make it pass quicker if you can smuggle things like a phone or books in your cell, or you can even add more time if you get caught fighting or doing anything else illegal.<br />
<br />
Barbelé was born under the name “GS project” for “sacrificed generation”. This idea that young immigrants from the projects go through the same thing over and over again. Like a cycle that does not allow you to move forward. Barbelé wants to be an analysis of society, of the police, of justice, of young people in the projects.<br />
The main feature of Barbelé is combat. The goal of the game is to get out of jail. After being sentenced to 2 years in prison, the player will have to try to survive to get out. A system of &quot;timer&quot; present in the game makes it possible to &quot;do your time&quot; to arrive at the moment when you become free. With each fight that you will make in front of witnesses of the penitentiary administration, you will add time to your sentence, you can even be sent to the &quot;hole&quot; for a given time so that you reflect on your actions.<br />
Several ways will be accessible to &quot;do your time&quot; and finally get out of prison. Not making waves and letting yourself be eaten by ill-intentioned prisoners can get you out sooner with reduced sentences or with your feet first... Fighting intelligently will offer you some advantages without risking increasing your time, and on the other hand, constantly fighting will help to establish your position in the prison, make money and easily get a phone in your cell to prepare for the rest of your incarceration. But this can get you into serious trouble, additional penalties that will constantly delay your exit.<br />
The use of the cell phone will be a major component of the game and there too, it will be necessary to learn to identify the guards' rounds and the schedules to know when it is possible to use the phone without risking being caught, which will result in an additional time, the loss of the phone which is very difficult to recover, and a passage to the hole.<br />
There are other ways to get out of jail...

<GameName>Bounty</GameName>
<CONTENT>
A student project made in Unreal Engine 4 at SAE Expression College. A demo level from our game Bounty.<br />
<br />
Bounty is a first-person shooter bounty-hunting game. The player lands on a space station overrun with robotic bounty hunters. The player must locate and kill the bounty. The player is equipped with a six-shooter that shoots explosive rounds. The player fights through the robot bounty hunters to claim the ultimate prize, his reward. The game is a tactical first-person game. The robots are just as deadly as the six shooters the character wields. The player uses a cover system to avoid being shot. The cover system allows the player to return fire in a deadly firefight a little more safely. The game's plot is to create a mix of wild west gunslingers in a future period. The story behind this bounty hunter is that his father owes money to an intergalactic crime syndicate. This bounty is the “last” job for the crime family before he can free his father from his debt or so he thinks. 7 user reviewsReminds me of Dead Space, the cover system is a really cool idea, makes me think, what if Gears of War could move the cover the way Portal does? A quick and easy play that feels tense the first time through.Cool vibe and fun game, gave me a bit of survival horror vibes tbh. It perhaps could've used more of a tutorial because it took me a bit to really "get" what the mechanics were like, for example at the beginning if the game told you how to crouch that would've been nice. Also, a boss fight near the end might have made it cooler. 

But all in all. This is a great prototype and I can't wait to see level two.This game for a collage project is good one problem I had is that there is no HUD in game i died one time because I didn't know how much health i had lost at the moment then i had to restart at the at the beginning overall good job keep up the good work.Walking is too slow, running is too fast, and everything just feels stiff. The devs seem proud of their dynamic cover system, but I never had to use it because bots can't shoot through railings.pros: Interesting atmosphere, well developed, nice particle effects
cons: needs skip-able cut-scenes, needs a story line to captivate players or something to have them return if a full game is being made, needs direction on how to use cover system, tried reloading but couldn't.

keep up the good work!Pleasantly surprised. Moody space shooter with a pounding soundtrack. Both the visuals and music design create a really strong sense of atmospheric tension, excited to see more!Reminds me of Dead Space, the cover system is a really cool idea, makes me think, what if Gears of War could move the cover the way Portal does?

Why? Not the game, although my thoughts have not changed, and about 4 hours is about all the "playing" there is.
It is because the dev has a very similar game, also at a cost that, is in the same state. If they had one game and were working on it? Sure, pay to get it. But this seems like a copy/paste cash grab, which is super sad, since the bones are there..

EDIT2: The devs response did not shine any light on why they released 2 games that are 20% complete, at the same time. My recommendation stays the same. Are you committed to making a good game, or making 2 games that are not really finished and make 2x as much cash? Pretty clear which the devs chose.

This is super beta material. The instructions (in English at least) are not that helpful and only 1 page saying not a lot.
Lots of stuff is not obvious, like only one of the "team" fights at once.
There is no scroll bar on the left, so it is VERY possible you will not notice there are more things to build (looking at you, Uranium!)
I would say I am half way through, and it has got to the point of my income being well high enough to just get each element, spam the buildings, get the next and repeat. Some balancing required.
There is very little in the way of decisions to make. Just make all the things until you need something (has happened twice in 4 hours...), go swap something over and you are done.

So why am I recommending it? Has good bones, I have enjoyed the 4 hours I have into it, and will probably "finish" it in another 4 or so. Tomorrow. :DGood idea for the game but the game is about 20% finished now. There are a lot of different resources but only few of them have specialized machinery, the rest are just copy-paste. Balance is non-existent, some things don't make sense. Why positive review then? Because I enjoyed playing it for 5 hours until it became obvious that it is not finished yet. So if you want to try it for few hours without expecting a full game, I recommend it.

I am not sure if it will be ever finished as their other game - Mining Copper was released two weeks before this one and also has reviews that say it is unfinished (I didn't play it myself) and instead of finishing one game dev released another.

So what is this game about? There are three parts in it: mining, making and exploration.

Mining:
You have several resources and each one has a machinery chain which basically starts from drilling holes, transforming them into tunnels, digging resources, transporting them, processing them into final product (either green/blue energy or just some resource which you store to use in other chains). Each stage in chain produces next resource and can also produce gold. You use gold to upgrade speed and yield of each stage. Some chains don't make sense, for example, you load impure coal into truck making truckload of coal, then unload truckload of coal into more impure coal at warehouse basically making impure coal out of nothing.

Making:
You use green energy to create 5 types of units. Each unit has rank and level. You produce rank 1 units. You can upgrade their level with gold and you can combine two of the same rank into one of the higher rank of the same type. So to create rank 9 unit you need to make 256 rank 1 units. After rank 9 it requires 4 units of the previous rank to make another, so 1024 rank 1 for rank 10, 4096 for rank 11, etc. After you upgrade a unit to a new level with cash you need to craft enough units to at least get it to the same rank before you can use it, luckily if you combine few units, one of which has higher level resulting level will be the highest of them.

Exploration:
You choose 3 unit types and the first unit of those types (usually the strongest unless you reordered them) goes into battle. Each level initially has 10 enemies, one of which is the boss (which increases by 20 each 5 levels). Rightmost unit attacks the enemy, then central unit attacks the enemy, leftmost unit attacks the enemy, and then finally enemy attacks your rightmost unit, so use tanky unit at the rightmost position. If enemy level is higher than your total level of three units then enemy attacks first otherwise you can just kill them before they get a move if your units are strong enough. You get sources of resources as a reward for exploration which are used to produce initial resource in Mining production chains. The further you get the more rare resource sources you find but because there is nothing special about those resources it is still better to just produce initial resources to convert them to green energy and gold. Yes you get more chains but because they cost more to upgrade they end up slower so increase is not very noticable.

And so that's it. Mine resources, produce green energy and gold, spend gold on upgrades, spend energy on crafting new units, combine units, fight.

<GameName>Grapple Whip</GameName>
<CONTENT>
This cowboy doesn't have legs so he uses his grappling whip to grapple from A to B. When the whip is attached to a grapple point the player will be pulled towards it. Collect all the gems in a level to progress while swinging. Move the crosshair over a grapple point to attach the whip and move forward. Different kinds of grapple points are scattered around the levels and can act differently based on their color. <br />
<br />
Some of the grapple points move to another place so the player can use them as transport and others give the player more velocity to reach more places. Sometimes it can be beneficial to detach from a point at the right moment to reach a gem or a new point. Watch out for rotating and moving spikes and dropping down in the abyss will make you start over but don’t worry you won’t have to collect all your gems again.<br />
<br />
Controls:<br />
<br />
Use the left mouse to attach your whip to a target.<br />
Use the right mouse to detach from a target.<br />
<br />
OR<br />
Use arrows/WASD and X to attach, Z to detach<br />
<br />
OR<br />
Use the left stick and button A to attach, B detach 3 user reviewsGrapple doesnt work

I hope the end bit can be fixed making it playableThe translations in this game were slightly off making it hard to read at times but overall it added to the charm and gave some good laughs. 

 The story was intriguing and made me think a lot about my own personal struggles with life and thoughts of suicide.

<GameName>Scrapbox</GameName>
<CONTENT>
<strong>HEY! This game is still a work in progress, and a LOT is being changed. Stick around for more info!</strong><br><br>Scrapbox is a frantic 2.5D fighter where a bunch of strange specimen beat each other up for little to no reason.<h2 class="bb_tag">ACCESSIBILITY FIRST</h2>Scrapbox was made with casual <i>and </i>competitive play in mind as opposed to leaning super heavily in either direction. The game has very easy inputs consisting of a direction, a button press, and your character's position (in air or grounded) instead of super difficult inputs that take 7.346 trillion years to learn. To make up for the game being easy to control, each character has a boat load of attacks - 8 Light Moves, 8 Mid Moves, 8 Strong Moves, 8 Special Moves and 3 Ultra Moves.<h2 class="bb_tag">SOME TECH, YES</h2>This game has a few ways to cancel moves. There's jump cancelling, which affects everything but Ultras, which is performed by inputting a jump during a small window as you attack. Land cancelling exists too - landing during an aerial cancels it immediately. On top of that, you can air dash in 4 directions, wave dash, dodge roll, and much more!<h2 class="bb_tag">ACHIEVEMENTS GALORE</h2>There are multiple achievements to snag for doing the most bizarre things possible. Every update brings new ones!<h2 class="bb_tag">MODES</h2>Just in case regular fighting gets old, there are a handful of other modes for you to enjoy!<br><br><ul class="bb_ul"><li><strong>TRAINING MODE</strong> lets you, well, train. You can see every character's hitboxes, speed up or slow the game down and more to let you lab with your favourite character!<br></li><li><strong>CAMEO KICKER</strong> has you punting tons of flying discs imprinted with characters that didn't quite make the cut. Good old arcade fun!<br></li><li><strong>TOUR MODE</strong> is the game's platform fighter hybrid, with huge stages and plenty of enemies to smack. Speed through the level or take your time battering each enemy one by one!<br></li><li><strong>CHAOS MODE</strong> throws balancing out the window and randomises every character's attributes. Good luck, have fun!<br></li><li><strong>TAG TEAM MODE</strong> lets you choose up to three different fighters and tag them in and out mid-match. If all three get KO'd, you're out!<br></li><li><strong>STORY MODE</strong> tells the most bizarre story ever seen in a fighting game. 'Nuff said.</li></ul>

<GameName>Polaris Outpost</GameName>
<CONTENT>
You find yourself alone on a remote research outpost in the Polaris system. Something has gone terribly wrong. Much of the base is lacking power and your co-workers are mysteriously missing. There is a deadly threat lurking in this outpost and it will take all of your cunning to keep from becoming another victim.<br><br>Your resources are dwindling, so you'll need to secure more food, water, and power, but this involves venturing away from the security of your home base. Equipped with various items to track, deter, and trick your adversary, there is a chance you can outwit your opponent. However, you'll need to keep a close eye on your stats, as it's all too easy to get dehydrated or lose your sanity to the extreme stress of these circumstances.<br><br>You will need to explore deep into your opponent's territory to find a way to escape this outpost. A distress signal may take too long, so maybe you can get the escape shuttle up and running instead. Or maybe there is a way to actually defeat this adversary. One thing is for certain, this won't be easy. Your adversary is becoming more intelligent by the minute, and it is adapting to resist your weapons. You'll need to move quickly and find more powerful equipment if you expect to stand a chance. Can you survive Polaris Outpost?<br><br><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2209080/extras/Vertical_No_text.png?t=1668453444" /><br><br>Polaris Outpost is a blend of survival, horror, and minimalist base building. It involves both planning ahead and thinking on your feet in order to survive. You will be up against a single powerful adversary that evolves to become stronger and more intelligent throughout the game. You will secure resource production rooms and find ways to defend or repair them. The gameplay is often tense and frightening as you try to out maneuver and outsmart your deadly opponent in a variety of atmospheric sci-fi environments. The game becomes progressively more open-ended, giving you more of a chance to make your own decisions.

Farm crops, tame alien beasts, incorporate salvaged technology and fortify your home against hostile intruders<br><br><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2209140/extras/Construction_-_Resized.gif?t=1669149424" /><h2 class="bb_tag">ENGAGE IN DEEP TACTICAL COMBAT</h2>Prevailing in combat will require more than just point-and-click. A detailed hit simulation and health system will mean that even non-lethal hits can render a survivor unable to go on. Suppressive fire might pin an enemy in place, but the ammunition used up may leave you ill-equipped to fight the next encounter effectively<br><br><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2209140/extras/Explosion_-_Resized.gif?t=1669149424" /><h2 class="bb_tag">DRIVE RESTORED VEHICLES</h2>It's a big world out there. To get around you will need better transportation than your legs can provide. One of the things setting Ascent of Ashes apart from other games of this genre is the ability to restore and drive vehicles.<br><br><br><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2209140/extras/Vehicles_-_Resized.gif?t=1669149424" /><h2 class="bb_tag">LEAD YOUR SURVIVORS</h2>Each survivor has their own unique personality and motivations. As colony leader it is up to you to find and recruit capable survivors to fill gaps in your roster against ever increasing challenges. Can you keep everyone happy, secure and motivated?<br><br><br><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2209140/extras/Campfire_-_Resized.gif?t=1669149424" /><h2 class="bb_tag">EXPLORE A STRANGE NEW WORLD</h2>You will find yourself in an expansive, procedurally generated world filled with different biomes and points of interest. To survive the post-apocalypse you'll have to brave the pre-collapse ruins and the many dangers that they hold.<br><br><br><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2209140/extras/Floaters_-_Resized.gif?t=1669149424" /><h2 class="bb_tag">CHALLENGE A DYNAMIC AI</h2>It's not enough to just have an in-depth combat system with a variety of mechanics. You also need opponents capable of using those mechanics to challenge you. Enemies will possess varying degrees of intelligence. Taking on a disorganized band of raiders will play very differently from fighting a squad of well-trained Remnant soldiers.<br><br><br><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2209140/extras/Dynamic_AI_-_Resized.gif?t=1669149424" /><h2 class="bb_tag">FROM THE ORGINAL CREATORS OF COMBAT EXTENDED</h2>Combining the deep simulation of classic post-apocalyptical survival titles with the tactical challenge of classic real time and turn-based gems, the original creators of RimWorld's heralded <strong>Combat Extended</strong> mod present a fresh take on the colony sim genre that emphasizes exploration, tight balance and strategic gameplay.<h2 class="bb_tag">MODDING SUPPORT</h2>Our team has its roots in mod-making and we've been fortunate to have been part of many great modding communities over the years. That's why with Ascent of Ashes, we want to give something back to those communities. We're building the game's engine from the ground up to be easily extendable, and thanks to our extensive experience in creating mods ourselves we know exactly what kind of support mod-makers need. Ascent of Ashes is a game developed by modders, for modders.

<GameName>Bebop</GameName>
<CONTENT>
Set in a distant future, a dystopian society struggles with crime and prostitution. In a dark alley, a sign on the door reads: &quot;Bebop, private investigator&quot;. But is he a private investigator really? I DON'T THINK SO. Bebop is involved with the mob, and he is about to embark on a journey without return. I mean, he will return home, but NOT THE SAME as before. Bebop will meet people that will shape his personality, he will go after those who wronged him, and he will, in the end, reach the end of his story. OR IS HE?<br />
<br />
This amazing adventure was written by Luis Felipe Pimenta, in his first attempt at creating a game. Hopefully, it won't be his last. His team is made of programmers doing artwork and artists doing programming.<br />
<br />
Bebop is a platform side-scroller pixel art adventure. Use physics to solve puzzles, travel through different places in Cybercity to complete your quests. <br />
<br />
Features:<br />
<br />
- 2D Physics puzzles<br />

<CONTENT>
In Raiders of Ruin, you guide a group of 5 champions sent on a quest to seize the throne of the Underworld itself. Along the way, you will encounter many deadly bosses and engage in challenging, strategic turn-based combat. You decide how to build your party, mixing-and-matching between 9 different classes, each with drastically different strengths and weaknesses. You can change classes any time, so experiment frequently to craft the perfect strategy for each enemy!<h2 class="bb_tag">Features</h2><ul class="bb_ul"><li>Over <strong>40 boss fights,</strong> each with their own unique mechanics. Expect multiple phases, colourful gimmicks, and ruthless attacks. <br></li><li><strong>No game-overs:</strong> Your progress is saved after every battle. Defeat simply means a chance to try again. <br></li><li>Study your enemies ahead of time by viewing the <strong>Boss Log,</strong> where you can find a record of your greatest foes and a description of their attacks. You must prepare to counter their strategies with a plan of your own!<br></li><li>Class-based combat system that's simple to learn, hard to master. <strong>Swap classes before any battle</strong> to arm yourself for the fight ahead. Find a combo that works for you and stick to it, or experiment frequently to find the perfect squad. <br></li><li><strong>9 main classes to choose from.</strong> Need more firepower? Swap that Paladin for a Wizard. Expecting a long fight? Try poisoning your foe with a Rogue.<br></li><li><strong>Multiple subclasses</strong> for most classes, providing even more customization. Should your Ranger be a Hunter, or a Survivalist?<br></li><li><strong>Innovative rematch system</strong> that replaces traditional level-grinding. Instead of fighting normal enemies repeatedly, you will occasionally be given the opportunity to rematch a boss of your choosing for a second chance at its rewards (though this system is entirely optional). <br></li><li><strong> MIDI soundtrack</strong> inspired by PC games of the early 2000's, with some modern twists. <br></li><li>A backpack that might be alive?</li></ul><br>-------------------------------------------------<br><br><i>&quot;I won't waste my time trying to plead with you.

Waking up in an asylum as one of its patients, you realize the doctor in charge has horrible plans for you. However, when you fall asleep, that's when you realize the true horrors of your situation. Your dreams are plagued by an alternate version of the asylum, where monsters inhabit the facility, and the laws of reality have been left behind. Using a modified flashlight with 3 different modes you discover that your world can be changed at the press of a button. Using this you can solve puzzles, defeat monsters, and explore parts of the asylum that defy reality to find your escape.<h2 class="bb_tag">Gameplay &amp; Features</h2><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2228840/extras/waterfall_steam_.gif?t=1670604461" /><br><ul class="bb_ul"><li>Puzzles &amp; Riddles<br></li><li>Multiple rooms and locations to explore<br></li><li>Story items to collect<br></li><li>Multiple weapons to find<br></li><li>Player powers<br></li><li>Merchants &amp; Upgrading<br></li><li>Boss fights<br></li><li>Multiple endings</li></ul><h2 class="bb_tag">Developer Inspiration</h2><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2228840/extras/EnemyStun_steam_.png?t=1670604461" /><br>When I started this project I didn't want to make a game with cheap jump scares or classic horror clichés. I wanted to create an experience that genuinely surprises the player and makes them feel like they never truly know what's going to happen next. From day one, I've always wanted the world to feel alive and story-wise it needs to. The world you exist in is not one based in reality and is carefully crafted to the player's actions in the game. The way you play changes the world around you, and I thought this was a really concept to explore.

Literally like 10 people knew this game existed, and I was one of them.

A huge thank you to Dreams Interactive and Strategy First for giving this game a chance to to be discovered again, it's an amazing little hidden gem that's just as addictively fun to play as it was when I played it as a kid. Though relatively simple nowadays, this very grungy cyberpunk/industrial Wipeout clone captivated me growing up.

My only complaint is that they seem to have not implemented the music for the game, possibly due to licensing issues (though the music label still appears on billboards in game and the music track selector still has the names of the songs). Growing up, I know that the game wouldn't play the music unless you had the CD in the drive, but you could still play the game without the music if you didn't have the disc. It could be that they just didn't implement the features that were on disc. If you want, go ahead and buy this version, but if you can find a copy on disc, get that too so you can experience the game with the music as originally intended by the original developers.I never imagined for the life of me that one of my favorite little bargain bin games growing up would ever make it on Steam.

<CONTENT>
<i>Broadside thunder,<br>steel plate sundered,<br>munitions ablaze,<br>once triumphant -<br>sinking to a watery grave,<br>Ruler of the Waves.<br>- Inscriptus</i><br><br><br>Man the turrets of mighty Dreadnought battleships and battlecruisers and blow your enemy out of the water to secure your position as... the Ruler of the Waves!<br><br>Ruler of the Waves 1916 is a naval combat game and turret-based shooter. The main gameplay involves aiming and firing the turrets. Since turrets take 30 seconds to reload, the player must utilize multiple turrets on multiple ships to maximize their firepower. Things are made more difficult due to the movement of the ships and the sea, and consistent accuracy will be a challenge to all but the most experienced gunner. Sink all the enemy boats to achieve victory - with bonus points earned for quickness.<br><br>The game follows, in a fictional sense, the major battlecruiser engagements in WWI such as the Battles of Heligoland Bight and Jutland, which would be the last time ships of this kind reigned supreme before improvements to high-flying aircraft and deep-diving submarines made them all but obsolete. <br><br>Dreadnought-era battleships and battlecruisers are similar in size and firepower, but differ in terms of armor thickness, turret layout, and speed. Battleships are more heavily armored, whereas battlecruisers have the advantage in mobility. <br><br>The player will have an opportunity to board both types of ship and unleash mighty salvos upon the opposing fleet.

Help Mr. Ball have a safe and comfortable trip 1 user reviewsI appreciate it's smooth controls. The game is just as described, every jump requires precision and patience for the right moments. I'm glad I wasn't able to save on my own and load the save if I fell, I feel like the challenge of the game would be reduced too much. Having to start from wherever you land is demoralizing, but I found it to be a part of the fun. Something I wasn't aware of at the start is how much your jump is charged, I was able to figure this out by seeing the light beneath Mr. Ball growing brighter.

You can play freely! In the great power play, it is a pleasure to let money talk about things, gather nuclear weapons and shoot them in unison!<br />

<br />
It also comes with a small storytelling scenario that covers all but major battles!<br />
In addition to that, it also includes small-scale conflicts such as the &quot;Battle of Malawi&quot; and IF's wars such as the &quot;Second Korean War&quot;!<br />
You can enjoy various big and small battles with this one piece!<br />

Masa Gorse 3 user reviewsReview at: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijQvCQ__Df4&t=10s
Well this game is not what I expected. A single small environment where you fight a single monster. No explanation of what the point of the story for this game is. No clear instructions on buttons. The only way to get out of the middle of the game is a hard exit or you die. The monster and you can glitch on invisible walls or rocks.The game is pretty and the monster looks cool but that is where the positives end. 

Firstly, the game is using 100% of my GPU. Performance aside, it is not clear at all what you're supposed to do. You can't even look up the controls in the options. You are just dropped into the forest with no weapon or any idea of how to make one, while the OST of the Witcher 3 if it was composed and performed by a drunkard blares in the background.

It has potential, but it needs some more work.

Edit:
The good news is that I found the weapons, the bad is the combat is just terrible.

I don't understand how the game works, there is no "help" or anything. It just wants you to do random bullshit without telling you what they need to do like feeding them or etc. There's no instruction or anything to help us enjoy the game. Waste of money

Cats will hide in all apartments of a multi-storey building. Search every corner of the room, move the pillows, open the bedside tables, check the toilet.... Cats can hide in the most unpredictable places.<br><br><strong>Key Features:</strong><br>- 5 floors;<br>- 250 cats;<br>- Hints;<br><br>During the development of this game, we were motivated by the game &quot;<i>A Building Full of Cats</i>&quot;. 9 user reviewsNow if you have played [i]A Building Full of Cats[/i] then you'll find this game strangely familiar. There is a thread in which the creator mentions that they did reach out to the other team asking for permission to borrow the concept which is to clear out several floors that are full of cats.

These levels have their own theme, colour and music. There is one scrollable screen on each floor and a bathroom you have to enter. Now, of the two games this appears to be the lesser one (there are no animations when changing floors) but I enjoyed it just the same. Looking for secret cats that require interaction with objects on our part is just pure fun! 

Perhaps it's best to start with this one of the two games so that the experience with [i]A Building Full of Cats[/i] will be a bit more enjoyable.A blatant rip off of another game with basically the same title, and this one is not as good.  All cats found within 30 minutes, and there are no secrets or surprises.  Achievements don't count on your profile.  I'd recommend the other game over this one.   I'm still giving this one a positive, because it's fine for what it is at the sale price of 40% off.In the game you need to find cute cats in different places of the room, all rooms are unique and visually beautiful.Has lovely colors, has lovely music, and the dev fixes bugs immediately. Is it similar to A Building Full of Cats? Indeed it is since the dev was inspired to make this game due to the other game. Listen folks, we can't get enough hidden kitty games so if you enjoy these types of games then pick this one up as wellI found some cats... Shocker.

<CONTENT>
As you come home from a long journey to see your son once more, you discover he is gone. A castle has been presumably summoned from thin air and it has a dark, gloomy presence to it. With this castle appearing, all the colours also disappeared, leaving everything looking lifeless. You hear a woman's voice in your head, beckoning you toward the castle. After grabbing your ancient shield and trusty boomerang you go towards an adventure that you simply don't know how will end. All you know is that you are going to save your son, no matter what it takes.<br><br><u><i>Gameplay:</i></u><br>The Search for a Colour Palette (TSFACP) has 7 levels in total, each ending with a boss at the end. Inspired by the classic Castlevania games from the 80's, you have to fight your way through monsters, unknown creatures, and beasts in order to get to your final destination: the castle. <br><br>At your disposal you have a boomerang that you can throw and also hover in the air with, knives you can pick up throughout the levels and throw at enemies for additional damage, and a holy shield with which you can block damage and jump on top of enemies. You also gain experience from killing enemies, making you even stronger...be careful not to kill too many though. Use all of these tools to your advantage, because there are some platforming challenges to be had in your adventure!<br><br><u><i>Credits:</i></u><br><strong>SeventyFour Productions</strong> - Programming, graphic design, spritework, cover art, mechanics<br><strong>Bro.

<img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2203610/extras/Follow.gif?t=1669738693" /><br><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2203610/extras/ant.gif?t=1669738693" /><br>Ants of Duty is a strategy game about managing a small colony of ants that find themselves in an unknown territory. You have to help them cope with the huge dangers on their way, such as red ants, wasps and crabs, so that the ants find their way back to their home. Get resources, build an army and defeat enemies.Особенности: a game for the speed of development of the colony, many different opponents, a game with a choice of consequences. PositiveThis is a scam; ignore the positive reviews--they have nothing to do with this 'game' and are completely misleading.  

Where to begin?  The main menu has 2 options:  Play and exit.  No options.  No instructions.  No tutorial.  Once you start the game, its even worse.  No instructions, terrible graphics.  

Gameplay consists of pressing 3 possible buttons (Q, A, and Z) to summon a worker ant (Q) or some fighter ants (the others).  The works automatically (and with about the stupidest AI imaginable) collect a leaf while you 'control' the warrior ants by clicking on them and sending them to attach the enemy 'base' which is always to the right by clicking on it.  No strategy, no depth.  There's one resource (leaves).  You can't build anything except the 3 types of ants.  Can't build any buildings. 

Oh, and usually if you try to select your ants, it takes about a half dozen times before the game registers it.  Imagine a RTS where there's 1 resource, 3 units which have almost nonexistent AI, completely empty levels, asset flip graphics and--somehow--a completely buggy UI that doesn't register your clicks most of the time.  That's 'Ants of Duty'.  Thank goodness for Steam's refund policy.Interesting game where you can feel like a king ant, it's interesting and fun, I advise you this game, there is interesting gameplay, convenient controls, it is not expensive and worth it to try to play, I really liked it

<CONTENT>
Shadow Lens is a found-footage video game set in the 90s. The game was never finished, its release in 2000 was due to developer negligence. I obtained the original code for the game and ported it to PC for you to play. There is a lot of unused content in the game files that can only be accessed with cheats. <br />
<br />
The game case reads:<br />
--------------------------------------------------<br />
Monsters lurk across your uncle's farm.<br />
Collect tools to unlock new areas.<br />
Upgrade your camera to navigate the darkness.<br />
Find your missing daughter.<br />
Discover what happened to her.<br />
Solve puzzles to get items.<br />
Complete quests for the locals.<br />
Get slimed and try again!<br />
--------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
The player is thrust into the role of a nameless protagonist tasked with investigating the strange happenings on an old farm. Discover the mystery of what happened to your daughter, Hantu. On the journey finding a plethora of tools and items to aid in her search. For example, your upgradable polaroid camera can be used to aluminate dark spaces. But be careful, because monsters often hide in these areas and are hard to see. To find Hantu, puzzles involving items must be solved. Most items can be interacted with, consumed, or picked up with your hand. Mastery of the tools and consumables is the key to finding Her. Hidden secrets from Cheat Codes to Unlockable areas litter the landscape. It is up to you to find them. Are you brave enough to look within the shadows and find Hantu?

The supreme robbery is coming. The powerful people in the world, or the newspaper group, seek the protection of the top forces, or close the door to repair, do not touch the cause and effect of the robbery. However, the most powerful people have created their own sects and schools to deal with the coming murders.<h2 class="bb_tag">[fighting Field]</h2><br>The fighting field is developed by the sage with supreme magic power.

The feather coat often has a hazy color, which does not annoy the peach and plum flowers in the world. There is a fairyland in the sky and an immortal mansion on the earth. Since ancient times, there have been thirty-six caves and seventy-two blessed places in the world of cultivators. A good fairyland is very important for cultivators. It can not only cultivate with peace of mind, but also arrange arrays and plant medicine. It is also the best place to avoid and defend.<h2 class="bb_tag">[marriage]</h2><br>Life is rootless, floating like dust on the street.

This game is a Virtual Reality First Person target shooting experience. You go through each environment in your elevator and clear the targets. The faster you clear them, the more points you get. Its THAT simple! 3 user reviewsI just can't recommend this freebie. I don't think it works as an aim trainer because the gun model is so bad and I don't know of a single VR game that this would train you for. The "gun model" doesn't even have iron sights. 

Also, this free to play title needs better optimization. I was getting shaky gameplay on my RTX 3080. I literally felt like I was doing target practice in the middle of an LA earthquake. 

It has a few levels. I did the levels several times before the 5 minutes was up so that I could post a review. I just wanted to quit real quick and never play again. Good luck to the dev, with some polish, this may be a good target practice / aim trainer in the future, but it's not there currently.I just can't recommend this freebie.

The pictures do not do it justice, this game is beautiful, my jaw dropped at one point. It's also very fun, i love exploring and looking in every corner so this game suits me perfectly.

[*]+ Availability: the game is free
[*]+ Beautiful graphics
[*]+ Professional camera
[*]+ Lots of living creatures to shoot
[*]+ Open world
[*]+ Pleasant nature sounds
[*]+ Unobtrusive soundtrack
[*]+ Simple controls
[*]+ Lots of filters and camera settings
[*]+ In-game encyclopedia
[*]+ To photograph some creatures, you will need endurance and patience

[b]Did not like:[/b]
[*]- Lack of settings
[*]- A small number of frames available for shooting
[*]- A bug at the beginning of the game: when using the prone position for the first time, the character could not stand up again. Until he fell off the cliff.
[*]- At times, when moving through the vines - the character's head begins to spin wildly.[/list]

[b]Conclusion:[/b]
A great little Indie-game in which the player simply has to explore a small map - and take photos of the animals they encounter. The more beautiful and "correct" the photo is taken, the better it will look in the encyclopedia.
An almost real camera is available to the player - in which he can not only use zoom, but also rotate, filters, and adjust the exposure / contrast of the photo. True, during all the manipulations - time does not stand still, therefore, having set the necessary parameters, the player will have to be patient - in order to catch an interesting frame again.
Not all living creatures in the world are harmless - and can sometimes fight back if the player gapes and gets too close. But do not worry - there is no concept of death in the game - after shutdown, the Robot will be restored at the last boot server.
The game is not big, but it's nice to spend time in it - having a rest from the industrial world in the bosom of nature.

<GameName>Hunting Life VR: Dove Season</GameName>
<CONTENT>
<strong><u>NOTE</u></strong>: This game requires a Meta / Oculus VR headset and controllers (Rift S or Quest 2 with Link). <br><br><strong><u>Bag your limit in a one-of-a-kind VR experience!</u></strong><br>From one of the designers of the best-selling Deer Hunter and Bird Hunter series of the past comes a thrilling new hunting game, designed and developed from the beginning to be played in VR! <br><br><br><br><u><strong>The Hunt</strong></u><br>Deep in the immersion of virtual reality, keep your eyes peeled for doves and your shotgun at the ready. But be sure that your target is a dove and not a crow or songbird or you’ll have to pay a fine for breaking the game laws! <br><br>Earn money for each dove that you bag and spend your earnings to buy new guns or “power ups” for a day (such as highlighting downed birds to make them easier to see). Choose your shotgun from a wide assortment of pump-action, semi-auto, side-by-side and over-under (in 12ga, 20ga, and .410). <br><br>Bag rare banded birds and see the location where they were banded and the age of the bird on special certificates in your farmhouse. Can you collect all of the 40+ band locations? Other, even more rare, birds await you in the field as well! <br><br><br><u><strong>Your Hunting Land</strong></u><br>Explore as you hunt your own private 550 acre hunting land. This area is dove heaven, containing sunflower fields, hay fields, wooded thickets and stock tanks. You hunt with a full 24 hour day-night cycle, so you can use your headlamp to get to your hunting spot before sunrise or find that bird that you downed just before shooting hours closed at sunset. <br><br>The realistic dove AI means that you are much more likely to find doves feeding in the early morning and evening, roosting through the midday, and sipping water and picking up some gravel in late mornings and early afternoons. <br><br>Doves can follow different patterns on different days, meaning that spot where you bagged your limit on a previous day may not be nearly as busy the next time you hunt. It is important to know where, and when, feeding and watering areas are…and where the birds roost, as you may kick some birds out of their roost by walking through! <br><br><br><u><strong>Hunt Your Way</strong></u><br>Hunting Life VR: Dove Season allows you customize your hunting experience to be what you want it to be. Do you want a realistic hunting experience with just a few doves that can spot you if you’re not in cover? Go for it! Or maybe you prefer tons of doves with no non-game birds? We’ve got you covered! Want to forget about game laws and just go out and have fun bagging birds with no limits? You can do that too!<br><br><br><u><strong>Action Challenge</strong></u><br>When you’ve gotten comfortable with hunting doves in Dove Season, be sure to try out the Action Challenge where you are set in the path of a never-ending flock of doves and you must down as many as you can before time runs out! Special silver and gold doves are worth more points and they add to your time. Stringing hits together will increase your score multiplier. Action Challenge takes it all: speed, accuracy, target recognition! <br><br>Hunting Life VR lets you enjoy the outdoors your way! <br><br><u><strong>Achievements</strong></u><br>Try to obtain 15 different Steam Achievements, including: <br><ul class="bb_ul"><li><strong>Peas in a Pod</strong> - Down two doves that hit the ground within 3 yards of each other. <br></li><li><strong>Double Trouble</strong> - Down two doves within 2 seconds.<br></li><li><strong>Not a Lost Cause</strong> - Bag 100 doves in a row without losing a single bird.</li></ul><br>Achievements are displayed in-game (per save) in the &quot;farm house&quot;. Some special achievements unlock shotgun skins that can only be obtained through earning the achievement! <br><br><strong><u>Lama glama Game Company</u></strong><br>We are an indie game company and we have roots in the game industry, specifically with hunting games. Lama glama founder, Tom Shiflet, served as producer / game designer on the best selling hunting games from Sunstorm Interactive, including the <strong>Deer Hunter</strong>, <strong>Bird Hunter </strong>and <strong>Rocky Mountain Trophy Hunter</strong> series. Hunting Life VR is returning to our roots as game developers…and combining our passions: enjoying the outdoors and video games! We hope that Dove Season is just the first of many seasons that we can bring to you in Hunting Life VR! 1 user reviews[h1]Experienced on the Meta Quest 2[/h1]

You can view my initial impressions & gameplay here: https://youtu.be/8WVSDbPqN78

I think Hunting Life VR has a good concept. A semi-realistic hunting setup which has you specifically hunting for doves. While the concept is neat, the execution is not. I find it difficult to say anything else positive about the experience.

The biggest thing (maybe) is that the visuals are poor, but also the game is poorly optimized. The game also has arcade-like gun mechanic that has you holding the shotgun with one hand. The gun mechanics are poor overall & just not realistic, along with the reloading being very finnicky. The game also has poor sounds & ugly UI.

Game is running on the Unity Engine. On my RTX 3080, I was getting variable frame rates from 40 to 90 fps throughout, although I did have all the graphical options set to max. You do have full locomotion, along with smooth or snap turning. The VR interactions are very basic here. You hold the shotgun in one hand, you spawn a shell in the off hand. You press grab to open the shotgun chamber with your off-hand and holding down. I had to try multiple times to reload the shotgun.

Overall, this game is just too expensive given the lack of polish, visuals, sounds, presentation, etc. I cannot recommend it.

You also find out that people appear to have abandoned this area. <br><br>Surviving in the Australian outback isn't easy - it is an extremely harsh environment with extreme temperatures, low rainfall, and little vegetation. The water is scarce.

You can either approach them directly with a weapon you crafted earlier, or you can build traps and prepare poisoned baits. <br><br>However, wildlife isn't your biggest problem. Extreme temperatures and dehydration is what usually kills people stranded in the Australian outback. You must find water. You must find shade.

<GameName>Rocket Escape</GameName>
<CONTENT>
Rocket Escape is an innovative 2D platformer about rocket jumping your way to the goal. Despite being around in gaming for a long time, rocket jumping is usually relegated to a side mechanic. However, we believed that rocket jumping could be so much more. Featuring mechanics such as slow motion/rocket time, speedrunning timers, black hole rockets, and more, Rocket Escape is an expansion on the time-tested concept of rocket jumping. We at Compact Square Studios have been working on Rocket Escape as a passion project over the last few years, and we are excited to be able to release the game on Steam and share it with the world.<br><br>We look forward to seeing how you approach and enjoy the game!<br><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2201680/extras/pickuplaunchersmol.png?t=1670204722" /> 6 user reviewsRocket Escape is a game that takes a lot from Portal.
It's short, it's fun, and it's not something that's really been done before.
For just a few bucks, I'd say it's a great buy.From its inception in 2020 to release in 2022 Rocket Escape has been a labor of love from the burgeoning studio Compact Square. With its simplistic yet detailed art style and portal-esque puzzle levels, Rocket Escape leaves the player not only wanting to finish the game, but also to reach perfection with its level clock. The easy mode makes the game accessible for those less game inclined. The level editor is sure to bring us a ton of fun for a long time to come. Thank you CS studios for such an amazing experience!Rocket Escape is a game that takes a lot from Portal.

<GameName>IN CELL</GameName>
<CONTENT>
IN CELL is a kinetic visual novel (linear, no choices) about the epidemic of sexless, nationless, and friendless men.  Gender dynamics are currently not functional, sustainable, or beneficial to either men or women.  IN CELL is an uncensored conversation between the sexes.  Not that such a conversation will solve anything.<br />
<br />
There are no specific characters, just mostly nameless men, and women.  It is better to think of men and women as the characters rather than specific people.  There are themes of racism, violence, sex, porn, and pretty much anything you could think of that may bother you.  There's a healthy dose of memes too as the subject matter necessitates it.<br />
<br />
You'll enjoy the hot new dating app &quot;Let's **** Chad!&quot;  You'll consider violence a reasonable solution.  You'll hate, you'll love, and you'll be numb.  IN CELL while primarily written by me does include direct quotes of men from youtube, 4chan, reddit, and other corners of the internet.<br />
<br />
IN CELL does not come from a place of wanting to solve the problem.  It is merely a talking point in the form of a visual novel.  I wanted to write about the modern male experience.  I was inspired by innumerable sources that I won't name as they may not want to be associated with this work.  I've read books, watched hundreds of thousands of hours of youtube videos, browsed forums, and have gone outside.<br />
<br />
I, like many other men, do not like this world.  IN CELL is about our experience as men.

Two words: Finnish Anime.

Definitely an enjoyable time to stream for some friends but you may want a few drinks, too. It's almost like fan-fiction of itself.

Constructive criticisms as of 11/25/2022:
1. Melee range is MUCH too far, it feels like enemies slap you from across the map.

2. The combat aiming cursor is frustrating, to put it lightly. It needs to show exactly where the mouse is or keep the same rotational speed regardless of distance from the middle of the screen, and lock the mouse to the screen. I found myself clicking off of the game mid-combat which was driving me nuts.

3. Adding use of the number pad in first-person fights would help a lot, those are hard. Increase time between block and attack a little. (Honestly, I'd replace it with just W, A, S, D, and Spacebar instead of 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 0, Spacebar.)

4. The enemies in the final boss fight do too much damage and attack WAY too fast, don't even try to get close to them.It was $2 well spent. I had a great time with it. Then I spent another $2 to buy it for a friend. 

The art style is very unique but it made me smile.

The game is BRUTALLY difficult. The melee range is very long and there aren't any swipe vfx or anything to tell how far melee swings are. Some visual effects would really help so you could see the swings. The melee enemies don't really have a 'tell' for when they attack, so melee back and forth combat is very difficult. The aiming is really weird. The cursor is used to aim, but the cursor is invisible. If the cursor was visible, the aiming style would work a lot better. Please make the cursor visible. 

The hand to hand combat sequences are fun but I think a Guitar Hero/Rhythm game style where the number drops down on a track would be a little more fun. The pauses between the enemy's attacks are very inconsistent and sometimes there are long pauses where they don't attack at all.

The mini games for upgrades don't have a "help" screen or tutorial, and some are very confusing (the sauna for example). And if you fail the mini game, you don't get an upgrade, which feels pretty bad. 

The HP and ammo types are all just text on the screen, I'd love to see actual UI icons. Hearts instead of numbers for health, bow and arrow icon with a number next to it for arrow ammo, etc.

The cutscenes and storyline was the real star of the show. It was a ton of fun to see.This game is really hard. Just like me when watching 'em manly cutscenes.

I hate the duels, they're super annoying giving you little next to no time to think. Getting to finish your opponent after is satisfying thoBoth people who reviewed this game are psychopaths and cannot be trusted. Do not believe their lies

Try it out if the bundle for all the games is cheap or this is going for $1-2.

Cowboys and Zombies... What can go wrong?<br />
<br />
Prove that you are the fastest gunslinger in the old west by literally shooting with your bare hands. You have to be quick or the zombies will eat you...<br />
<br />
The game has two modes: Story mode and Hands tracking or Time mode.<br />
In the story mode the player can move freely around the stage, he will have to find the way to go to the next level.<br />
<br />
In hands tracking mode, the player remains static in one position, having to survive the zombie attack for a certain amount of time. You can use the Quest, Quest 2 and Quest Pro goal cameras, to play, you do not need controllers. Playing without controllers is less accurate, but can be more fun...<br />

Designed for Pico 4, Oculus Meta Quest 2, Valve Index, Pimax, HTC Vive and Quest Pro PC-VR, Hands Tracking Mode. 2 user reviews[h1]Experienced on the Meta Quest 2[/h1]

<GameName>Forge of Destiny</GameName>
<CONTENT>
Faced with the impossibility of halting the extinction of humanity, a planetary contingency plan was activated for the relocation and protection of the surviving people. Promoted and financed by the world's leading technology company of the time, Inductrack, a program was devised to build colossal metropolis contained in domes or vaults, which would be known as Nodes or dome-cities.<br><br>Although originally there were more than three thousand Nodes, the number of operational dome-cities is not known at present. Political instability and constant internal conflicts, as well as the altercations that occurred during the insurrection of the rebel coalition of Diurna against the government of the Regency of Omnis, provoked confrontations that, in many cases, ended with the total destruction of the structures that provide vital support to the domes.<br><br>Gradually, the idea of finding another way of life fell into oblivion. The Nodular Governments rewrote the events of the past to maintain absolute control over the inhabitants of the dome-cities, who submitted to the idea of isolation and the impossibility of leaving their own Nodes, believing that there was no existence but themselves.<h2 class="bb_tag">The control of truth</h2>.<br>At present, VΣRÐΔÐ is the only truth that exists. The citizens of the Nodes are engaged in the search for arcana in order to increase their influence and thus acquire privileges based on their reputation. Meanwhile, Diurna maintains her combative spirit, organizing assaults and skirmishes, hoping that, one day, the scales will finally tip in her favor.<h2 class="bb_tag">1st Chapter</h2><br>Enter the universe of &quot;Forge of Destiny&quot; as an inhabitant of the Fourth Node-capital. Discover the secrets hidden in the sands of the ruin district and witness the beginning of your story. An initial journey that will lead you to discover the reality of a new society built on the ruins of the past. Thus, finding the truth will be essential to discover what really happens within the walls of the Node-capital.<h2 class="bb_tag">The Forge of Destiny</h2><br>This first chapter, which begins the saga &quot;Forge of Destiny&quot;, has been coordinated by Dr. Alberto González Fernández, with the participation of his colleagues from the Nodo Educativo Research Group, as well as the illustrator Francisco Kobo and the composers Nacho Márquez and Víctor Rodríguez. A project funded by the COTEC Foundation and developed by the Video Game Laboratory Nodo Play.

<GameName>Now You Would Destroy The Earth</GameName>
<CONTENT>
The year is 1981. Seven years since some strange disease ripped through the city of Sennenmoor, a quarantine cutting it off from the world. Seven years that have seen it forgotten, left to rot amongst the moorland. Five years since you last saw him. Five happy years together and then, suddenly, five years apart. No warning. One day he was just gone.<br>Three weeks since the letter. Written in shaking hand, though undeniably his. Still the smell of him hanging a little on the paper, still the letters slanting more as they went on, rushed and desperate. <br>Two weeks since you took a job as a research scientist in a dead and broken city, for you knew where the letter came from, though you didn't know how, nor how he'd gotten back. The city of his birth, the city he often said he wanted to go back to, one day, to stay, to live out your lives there.<br>Two hour since you took a military train southbound from Glasgow towards Sennenmoor. A letter in your breast pocket. On it, written in scrawled hand, the words;<br><i>We're going home, Elias.</i><br><br><i>Now You Would Destroy The Earth</i> is a top-down psychological horror narrative adventure about a man seeking answers from a lover he thought long gone, across the backdrop of a city torn apart by a strange disease. With multiple endings, paths and secrets to find, converse and navigate your way through the broken streets of Sennenmoor to find the truth about the man you once loved, and the nature of the disease itself.

Anyone who enjoys the Napoleonic wars will find the tactical thinking required for Imperial Ambitions to be much more rewarding. As you forge an empire, the battlefields will become more challenging. We've redesigned the way that armies move on a campaign map, so they act more like real-world military units. Large armies move in column formation, making it harder to move and requires more tactical thinking to prepare for the battle. The regiments can be split from the main army for small tactical excursions, or sneak into enemy lines for crossfire. For the same reason, attention is required to avoid leaving gaps on your frontline.<br><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2219390/extras/UIs.png?t=1670527388" /><h2 class="bb_tag">Production Chains</h2><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2219390/extras/engineer.png?t=1670527388" />Your Empire will grow beyond the mountains and the seas. As it grows you will have access to more and endemic resources. The more you invest into your roads and docks, the more resources that produced around the corners of your empire will be transported into your capital. With abundance in your capital, you can allocate your laborers to produce to higher quality goods. Imperial Ambitions has more than 40 different resources that can be extracted, produced or imported. Your population will demand products depending on their level of education. You must manage your resources and customize your production chains, while ensuring the wellbeing of your population. Some key resources may just not be accessible to you. You can resolve either by leasing the land from the natives, military invasion, trading with superpowers, or exploiting black market.<br><br><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2219390/extras/Industry_in_IA_01-2-2.gif?t=1670527388" /><h2 class="bb_tag">Black Market And Trade</h2><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2219390/extras/merchant.png?t=1670527388" />For the savvy entrepreneur and economist, the black market is a huge opportunity to boost your own empire. No longer do you have to go through the tedious and sometimes costly process of building a colony and maintain an industry. the game will include a black market besides the regular market. In regular trade, a player can initiate a bid for something they need and, if another player sells it to them, everyone is happy! Though, this trade is also taxed by any country that has lands en route. Black market, however works completely different. The resources in the black market is pulled from towns with high corruption. And players can bid for these resources, even if they belong to their enemies. The cost, however, is often higher than normal, yet no one can tax. This can be a boon for some players in need of certain products that are capitalised by their enemies and for everyone that prefers not to pay taxes. Instead, however, corruption and criminal activity will become more prevalent among the towns along the route. e careful not to get caught in a cycle of corruption and crime! To promote corruption player can send man of shadows to start a crime syndicate. It however requires opium to initiate (also only available at black market) However, the player is not defenseless. Players can use the man of shadow to start intelligence mission, to eradicate crime syndicates.<br><br><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2219390/extras/social_classes_states.png?t=1670527388" /><h2 class="bb_tag">Social Classes</h2><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2219390/extras/artisan.png?t=1670527388" />The society in the game is divided into classes, slaves, peasants, apprentices, artisans and masters. Besides slaves, the citizens will be allowed to progress through four tiers of classes, with each step providing increased capabilities, but also requiring different resources from you. The education is the key for most of your citizens to climb this social ladder. Higher classes will provide exponentially more labor, but will also require unique luxury resources. The citizens may stop working for several reasons, such as training, hunger, epidemic, strike, accidents, criminal activities, exhaustion, rebellion or retirement. While higher classes are often preferable, they are also harder to maintain due to requirement of luxury. The units and agents are also required to be trained from respective classes. For that reason, the players need to find the optimal balance between these classes.<br><br><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2219390/extras/boats_in_IA_02.gif?t=1670527388" /><h2 class="bb_tag">Undisclosed Tech Tree</h2><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2219390/extras/spy.png?t=1670527388" />In our opinion, it is unrealistic for the players to be able to view the tech tree. In Imperial Ambitions, the player will only be shown the available techs they can fund without disclosing the whole tree. It makes the game more challenging and exciting. This is also part of the discovery experience in Imperial Ambitions - you learn by doing! Funding a tech is not enough for research. The player must have one of their gentlemen agent perform an action related to that technology to be able to discover it. This action is also not revealed to the player. Thus player has to make a guess to what actions would help discover that tech. For example, a gentlemen has to sail the ocean to be able to discover the &quot;Sextant&quot;, a navigation tool for sailors. Or, to discover &quot;Abolishment of slavery&quot; the player need to actually working slaves.<br><br><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2219390/extras/eventReportButtons.gif?t=1670527388" /><h2 class="bb_tag">Diplomacy</h2><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2219390/extras/diplomat.png?t=1670527388" />We envision a simple diplomacy for Imperial Ambitions. The difference in IA from most 4X, is that an agent has to be sent to the opponent's capital or party in an effort to ceasefire, establish trade relations, embassies, defensive pacts and alliances. Once an embassy or trade consulate is established the agent is dismissed. On the other hand, cancelling an existing agreement can simply be performed from the diplomacy window. It takes days to build bridges but seconds to destroy them.<br><br><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2219390/extras/gampley.png?t=1670527388" /><h2 class="bb_tag">Pixel Art Design</h2><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2219390/extras/janissary.png?t=1670527388" />We chose a pixelated art style for the game since it’s a fun and approachable way to communicate controversial events of our recent history such as post-colonial subversion. We also wanted a retro aesthetic design to assist players in imagining this alternate universe, mixing pop culture with classic cartoon representations of imperialism.

<GameName>Interregnum Chronicles: False Prophet</GameName>
<CONTENT>
Interregnum Chronicles: False Prophet is a tactical, turn-based strategy game about survival in a post-apocalyptic world of eternal winter.<br><br>An extraterrestrial mind-virus has struck the Earth, killing 95% of humanity while the poles have shifted and the world is plunged into a new ice age. Lead a group of survivors as the titular False Prophet to a promised land - a lie manufactured in a desperate bid to save your lost child. Find out if goals do justify the means, and what a desperate parent is willing to do to save their child.<br><br>This is the second entry in a series of games which tell the story of the Interregnum and its aftermath, based on the world created by Przemysław Karda.<h2 class="bb_tag">Gameplay</h2><strong>Fight</strong> for your life in turn-based tactical battles against desperate survivors like you. Use suppression and flanking to outsmart and outmaneuver your enemies. Experience a realistic depiction of a firefight in which suppression plays a key role.<br><br><strong>Survive</strong> the biting cold and ever-present hunger. Scavenge resources while trudging through frozen wastes of California. Loot, craft, and make the best of what you find. <br><br><strong>Explore</strong> alien anomalies and extraterrestrial phenomena that transcend human understanding. Alien civilizations fight over Earth with no regards to its human inhabitants. Their struggle is completely beyond human understanding as it warps the very structure of reality. <br><br><strong>Recruit</strong> survivors to your cause. The people you meet often have their own quests - how far will you go to convert them to your cause? The sick and the children are unable to work - will you leave them to die or make them part of your pilgrimage? <br><br><strong>Manage</strong> your caravan and the people that follow you. Their survival is in your hands, but if they lose faith they might just replace you. Launch expeditions to gather resources, divide the workforce, and guide your flock. The survival of the group will require sacrifices.<h2 class="bb_tag">Features</h2><strong>Tactical Combat</strong><br>Turn-based tactical combat with emphasis on realistic depiction of firefights. Suppression plays a key role as every shot drains the Action Points of its target and those nearby. Defeating enemies requires smart use of the fire and maneuver tactic. Your characters can have an array of special abilities that allow them to manipulate the battlefield - change turn order, transfer Action Points or mitigate the effects of suppression.<br><br><strong>Deep Survival Mechanics</strong><br>Managing warmth, hunger, and fatigue of your characters is as important as winning battles. Rationing food and deciding when and how to establish a campsite will be crucial to survival in the harsh environment of a post-apocalyptic winter. Choosing what your characters wear affects how fast they lose warmth, and must be balanced with gear that protects them in combat.<br><br><strong>Original Story</strong><br>The world of Interregnum is an original setting in which extraterrestrial beings are completely beyond any human. In this post-apocalyptic world, ordinary people are fighting for survival while the very structure of reality is being torn apart by a struggle beyond their understanding.

Has a cursed staff, she has vowed to never touch another human. However, her destiny is precariously set in motion by the visit of three courageously knights.<br><br>She is feared as a witch. All who approach her are said to meet their end. <br>Some say she can control the very elements themselves.<br>Others say she has the power to summon creatures from the darkest depths of the underworld.<br><br>No one knows for sure what she is capable of.<br>But all agree that it would be best not to cross her.<br>But there is a trace of the ordinary girl she used to be in the way she loves to make snowmen. Maybe somewhere deep down, she still yearns for the happy childhood she once had.<br>The engraving on her body is proof that she is the owner of a cursed relic.<br>The relic is what makes her loneliness, but deep down she knows it is a part of her. Without it, she would be lost. It is her strength and also her weakness.<br>The eyes looking into the distance seem to be searching for someone she should avenge. Perhaps that is what brought her out for this journey. Her quest is clear to her, even if no one else understands. <br>She is looking for the person who took everything from her and destroyed her life.<br><br><br><strong>Magic Combat</strong><br>-Ice Spike<br>A huge ice spikes suddenly protrude from the ground, inflicting intense physical damage on the enemy.<br><br>-Ice Lance<br>&quot;Just get in line.&quot;<br>A spear of ice pierces through a swarm of enemies. The ice quickly spreads through their bodies, inflicting physical damage.<br><br>-Vortex<br>The vortex lifts the enemy into the air and deals magic damage. Smaller enemies are helpless against this assault, but larger ones cannot be hoisted up by the vortex. Consequently, they are only damaged by the magic, not lifted into the air.<br><br>-Blizzard<br>This ability deploys a localized snowstorm at the target location. The storm lasts for a certain amount of time and inflicts continuous magical damage to enemies who step into it. This makes it a great way to deal damage to multiple enemies at once and can be very helpful in crowded areas.<br><br>-Frost Breath<br>Exhale a breath of frost. It inflicts freezing damage to enemies caught in it. Enemies who stay in it for too long are frozen. It is powerful but has a short range.<br><br>-Chilling Aura<br>A  spell of ultra-low temperature, creating an aura of freezing cold.  She can maintain the aura for a certain period of time, dealing freezing damage to any enemies who enter it. Any creature who touches it for a long time is frozen .<br><br>-Rush<br>The ability to travel short distances instantly by concentrating magic power is a skill that takes much practice to master, but helps to avoid danger. The more proficient wizards can travel longer distances for extended periods of time, but they use up more Mana. This is why it's easy to imagine that high-level wizards are able to travel great distances very quickly.<br><br>-Ice Golem<br>It was an accident. The witch, who used to make snowmen by hand, tried to create them with her magical powers and an ice doll was born. Since then it has been a reassuring companion who supports her long spell chanting.<br><br>-Ice Wall<br>Sturdiness is key when it comes to defending yourself. So a little ingenuity on the ice spikes is essential to keeping those pesky enemies at bay. Walls that emit cold air can freeze nearby enemies, but they don't seem to cause any damage. However, the frigid temperature is enough to made them extremely uncomfortable.<br><br>-Spell Chain<br>You will be caught off guard if you think chanting is the only way to release your magic.  there are many other ways to release your magic. Chanting is just one method. This snow witch seems to be particularly good at planting the next spell in the one she has unleashed. It's as if she has a special talent for it. The snow witch is always one step ahead, and her opponents never know what's coming next.<br><br>-Spell Combo<br>One relatively easy way to push one's limits is to exalt. One example is the battle cry uttered by warriors.<br>The rhythmic spell releasing will give her pleasure. The more she combos them, the more their power leaps.<br>A gauge will appear for a moment in the middle of the screen after she releases the instant spell. Release the next spell at the right time in the center of the gauge.<br><br><br><strong>Adventurous Companions</strong><br><br>- Ride her beloved unicorn horse and play with your enemies.<br>- The more powerful the magic, the longer it takes to concentrate, so summon your trusty golem to act as your shield. He scales in strength and size depending on the magic and skill you invest in him.<br>- Some of the enemies you defeat will drop their souls on rare occasions. You can summon them as companions at a cost during the adventure to form your squad. They have levels, which are permanently inherited.<br><br><br><strong>Growth System</strong><br><br>Permanent growth elements:<br><br>-Perk<br>At the end of your adventure, you will receive a score based on your play. Spend them to build up permanent power-ups.<br><br>-Companions<br>As mentioned above, the strength of your companions is inherited. Your companions will become your reassuring allies in your adventures.<br><br><br>Growth during adventures:<br><br>Schnee has no levels and grows with loot from enemies and the map during adventures. You can obtain spells of random performance and enchant them to your liking in terms of power, range, and chain probability. Think about synergy with her own status boosts and build your own build.<br>		<br><strong>THE STORY</strong><br><br>As you continue your adventure, artwork about the world and the witch's origins will open up.

新人サンタクロースとなった貴方は、上司ニコラウスの指示でクリスマスの配達に出発します。<br />
トナカイ「ヴァンデアッグ」の導きで精神のトンネルをくぐり、落っこちた先は「子供の夢の中」。<br />
寝ている子供の魂を探し、プレゼントを枕元に置いて去れば、お仕事は達成。<br />
ニコラウスからサラリーを貰えるでしょう。<br />
<br />
でも、貴方も、きっと迷ったことありますよね？<br />
プレゼントって、何をあげるのがいいのでしょうか？<br />
<br />
ニコラウスから受け取った、「シン・ニコラウスの書」によれば……<br />
良い子なら嬉しいものを、悪い子にはチェーンソー（の刃のできるだけ先端の尖っている部分を、できるだけ速度が出ている状態で）をプレゼントしなければならないとあります。<br />
<br />
子供の夢の中を見て回り、その子が世の中にとって役に立つ良い子なのか、調和と信仰を乱す悪い子なのか、きちんと大人の判断をしてあげることが大切です。<br />
夢の中に入っていられる時間は、PM 11:00 から、AM 00:00 までの 1 時間。<br />
夢の中を徘徊する家畜やペット、父親や母親といった、邪魔で汚れたニコラウス的にあまり良くない存在も、注意しなければいけません。<br />
時にはそれらがヒントになることもあるかもしれませんが……。<br />
<br />
ニコラウスから与えられたノルマは 5 人への配送。<br />
これを達成して来年からは高級サンタとして活躍するか、<br />
はたまた、きついことで有名なニコラウスのお仕置きを食らってしまうのか、<br />

Every early December another kid from your school goes missing, and rumors on the playground have circulated that it's related to Krampusnacht- the night that a half-goat half-demon named Krampus comes and steals away naughty children and spares the good. But what is it that determines if people are taken by Krampus?<br><br>For Goodness Sake is a very <strong>short horror text heavy game</strong>, focusing on several trolley problem situations. While completing the chores around the house, you find yourself reflecting on situations involving the neighborhood kids that have gone missing &amp; ultimately deciding what you think might have been the right thing to do. <strong>Will you be taken by Krampus at the end of the night like the others, or will you be spared?</strong><br><br><ul class="bb_ul"><li> Playtime: 15-20 minutes.<br></li><li> 3D first person navigation<br></li><li> Ending depends on your answers given<br></li><li> Rich audio design and atmosphere</li></ul><br><br><br>Created in one month, for the HauntedPS1 community's Madvent Calendar 2022 project.<br><br>This was created as a small mental break from DEAD LETTER DEPT, an atmospheric typing horror game currently in development.<br><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1627350/Dead_Letter_Dept/?utm_source=ForGoodnessSakeSteamPage" target="_blank" rel=""  id="dynamiclink_0" >https://store.steampowered.com/app/1627350/Dead_Letter_Dept/?utm_source=ForGoodnessSakeSteamPage</a> 8 user reviewsAs Christmas is just 2 weeks away [i]For Goodness Sake[/i] is the perfect game to play now. You control a kid who decides to do some household chores before going to sleep while other family members are asleep. The order of completion doesn't matter - the objective is to make a decision every time he completes a chore as he remembers something. Something that happened at school be it bullying or stealing or lying. The stories are all connected with children disappearing.
 
As we remember we have the opportunity to reflect and assess the situation. What happened, who was at fault and what should have been done. These decisions will eventually determine our fate with Krampus. Are we naughty or we do not deserve to be punished?

This is one of those games with simplistic graphics that one may consider too simplistic - outright ugly, actually. The filter used here is meant to hide this and instead there is greater focus on the atmospheric gameplay with particular emphasis on the sound design. Due to it being dark I had issues with the filter but I appreciated the well-placed light sources. This is a surprisingly fun, short game I can only recommend!https://youtu.be/KhDhPtx6V-o

<CONTENT>
Creates 3D VR scenes from 2D input using depth estimation machine learning model.<br />
<br />
Takes any images or videos, estimates the depth using MiDaS model, and draws it in the 3D space for your VR HMD! <br />
You can save the depthmap output to use it later, record a 3D VR video to upload on Youtube. This program also can fetch the screen of your desktop and show the depth. 3 user reviews[h1]Experienced on the Meta Quest 2[/h1]

You can view my review & gameplay here: https://youtu.be/3-XrHTP2KxQ

This app is not perfect. It will not render every single 2D / pancake photo or video into perfect 3D for viewing in VR. However, when it works well, it works really well. Sometimes it looked like the photo or video was native stereoscopic 3D of high quality. Other times, not so much.

I think the key thing is that the photo needs to have some natural depth to it, even if it's in 2D. The photo or video also should be of high quality (4k or higher resolution recommended) and the lighting and sharpness should be good overall. The part you want in 3D should be in focus on the photo or video. 

Anyways, you can check out my video where I test several different photos and videos using the app. Overall, I was impressed by how good the quality was, although you'll also see several times where it didn't work so well. This app is free to play so I can easily recommend it. Please note though: motion controllers are not currently supported. You'll have to use mouse and keyboard. Also note: it initially renders to your desktop only. From there, you'll have to choose a source of where the supported video / photo formats are located. I used mostly mp4s and jpgs and they worked fine.

Digital Eclipse Arcade: Invasion of the Buffet Snatchers is the latest in a series of all-new games inspired by classic '80s arcade vibes.<br><br>The ravenous Buffetlians from the planet Divowrr travel the galaxy in search of savory delights — and they've finally set their sights on Earth! But instead of eating the populace, they're curious to participate in the exotic culinary ritual they assume was named for them: &quot;the buffet.&quot; Attracted to the bright lights of Las Vegas but lacking the social graces (and opposable thumbs) of the local populace, the Buffetlians expect to be served immediately upon their arrival — and if they don't get the food they crave, they'll start snacking straight from the buffet itself!

It might be less lucrative to deliver the food one item at a time, but it's safer.

Not to mention the barely-there shorts she always puts on when she’s training with him…or the sweet moans she lets out whenever he makes her do the squats. She’s hot, confident and always flirting with him. No wonder poor Daniel has a hard time focusing on anything other than those sexy glutes of hers and the training always ends with the need of a very cold shower. <br>The problem is…she has a boyfriend. And a very cocky one. Travis Finn is not the guy to be messed with, especially when it comes to his gorgeous young girlfriend.<br>…<br>It’s Monday evening. Daniel and Amber are in the middle of their training when Travis walks in and catches the trainer ogling his girlfriend’s ass. He has a reputation to maintain, so there’s no way he can let the boy’s indiscretion pass without some kind of punishment.<br>Luckily for the trainer, he’s in no mood for punching the boy, so he decides to try another tactic and put the boner in his pants to great use.<br>…<br>Will Daniel learn his lesson not to mess with other guy’s girlfriends?<br>Follow our story and find out…<br><br><strong>Features</strong><br>- 60+ HD renders<br>- Animations 2 user reviewsI am 69 year old happily married woman.

[h1]Synopsis[/h1]
Sex Adventures - Cuckold Gym is a railroad visual novel.

[h1]Story[/h1]
Daniel is a trainer at a gym and Amber is one of his favorite clients. She is one of the hottest girls he's ever had the pleasure of training. She's hot, confident and always flirting with him. The problem is she has a boyfriend. One night Amber comes in for her session and it is just Daniel and her in the gym. Things take a turn as Amber's boyfriend Travis walks in while Amber is working her glutes as Daniel supervises.

[h1]Gameplay[/h1]
The story is told from an omnipotent point of view, you know the thoughts of all of the characters. The text in general isn't bad, there are a few typos and poor word selections, using bread instead of bead for instance.

The "chapters" are basically different scenes or location changes. After each chapter you have the option of replaying the scene or continuing the story. As you advance in the story you are given the option to watch the movie of the scene.

The title is a bit misleading as I wouldn't call this a cuckold story. Yes, Daniel does do the girl, but under Travis' supervision and only after Travis humiliates Daniel making him watch.

[h1]The Gallery[/h1]
There are two Galleries, an image gallery with 55 images, basically every image in the game, and a video gallery that is unlocked by finishing the game. In order to access the video gallery you will need to save the game at the end, it cannot be accessed from the main menu.

[h1]Final Verdict[/h1]
I don't consider it to be a Cuckold story. The images are fine. There are some issues with the text, mostly the wrong word used. If you enjoy other Erotic Games Club games you'll probably like this one.

[h1]Synopsis[/h1]
Hentai Nurse is a Unity is a swapper puzzle game. You pick a piece and drag it where you want it and when you drop it, the piece that was there moves to where the piece came from.

[h1]Gameplay[/h1]
The game starts off easy with a six piece puzzle and the puzzles increase in complexity as you progress. There is no real logic behind the number of pieces, as they will increase and decrease as you progress. When the puzzle appears you get a brief glimpse of what the finished puzzle is supposed to look like. There are only a couple of the later puzzles that have similar color pieces that you may need to swap to complete. There are 24 images in total that increase in lewdness as the puzzles progress.

[h1]The Gallery[/h1]
There is no Gallery, however you can cycle through the puzzles you have completed to see the images again.

[h1]Final Verdict[/h1]
Hentai Nurse, like the other Hentai works games on Steam, is an inexpensive puzzle game with good art.

<CONTENT>
超级好的游戏，杨君朝的第三作，王子斗恶龙3 绝望！！引用了全新的Cocos2d-x3.9引擎，全新的画面，全新的内容，全新的玩法。本游戏为未来一直手游端做准备，引用了触摸事件，为全鼠标点击游戏。用鼠标移动，鼠标点击。故事背景，终于到了节目的最后，王子只要再击倒龙，就能达到登上皇位的境界，加油吧！<br />
玩法：全鼠标触摸点击，用鼠标移动，点击空旷处即可移动，系统会辨别您的点击位置来横向或纵向行走。右上角是菜单点击出现菜单栏，和勇者斗恶龙很像。<br />
特点：可以保存，学DQ，固定地点保存，也就是教堂，这里是城下町的某处。菜单栏有道具，点击能查看装备，草药等。属性，可以看能力值，能力值有HP，MP，攻击力，防御力，金钱。攻击力防御力会被装备加成，咒文是恢复咒文，但在地图上不可使用。可以在城下町购买装备和道具，道具就是草药，可以恢复生命到战斗前。<br />
场景：这是在大陆上，一开始是在王城，一开始是在王座之间，就是国王的位置，会有侍从-小兵，再往下走是王城大厅，这里有不少人了，每个人都有文本。出去是城下町，冒险就开始了，是全彩世界。<br />
战斗系统：回合制战斗系统，有普通攻击，咒文，道具（草药），和逃跑，完全DQ模式，让你沉浸在勇者斗恶龙模拟世界，，攻击先后是随机的，攻击防御都和购买的装备有关联。咒文有攻击咒文和恢复咒文，运用了战斗特效和粒子系统，使得很漂亮，和NDS勇者斗恶龙匹敌一下可以。<br />
音乐：成本很大，游戏不大，音乐媲美勇者我觉得。<br />
细节：为了使玩家玩得流畅，我取消了升级打怪，简化金钱，使得玩家能顺利过关，要有很多耐心游玩。

As a conscience, you have the opportunity to follow everything the main character does and goes through. You get a glimpse into his hidden memories that put him on this wicked path. However, you don't have the ability to manipulate him because there is an even more mysterious entity with you that is the main instigator, controlling behavior, lusts, and the desire to hurt. <br><br>You are exposed to many interpretations of his worldview, both external and internal, his struggle with himself, and it is up to you to help him. If you manage to weaken his inner will enough, you may end his story much sooner than you think. Or you can walk all the way to the end, learning the whole story through his memories, but at a terrible cost. You are in for a surreal journey through the subconscious, the inner demons and the bitter realities of the world. <br><br>It is important to note that this is still a beta demo.

[h1]Synopsis[/h1]
Emma in the Library is a RenPy literary quiz visual novel.

[h1]Story[/h1]
You wake up after a night of drunken sex to find that the woman you were with has taken your books, wallet, laptop, and phone. The sex was good, but it wasn't that good. She will return your things in exchange for you writing her term paper for her…by tomorrow. Good thing you're great at writing paper.  You head to the library to use one of their computers and to research the paper.

None of the books on the list she gave you are available in the library. Fortunately a search on line reveals a nearby library where you can at least get one of the books. You drive the half hour to get the book you need. There you meet Emma.

[h1]Gameplay[/h1]
You start of by entering your name. You go to the library and meet Emma. Next you spend the week selecting what you want to do with your time. You have two papers to write and you need to study for Emma's test. When you study for Emma's test it gives you a free pass on a question. You can also check your phone as Emma keeps sending you pictures trying to figure out what's she's going to wear for your test. Emma also hid some pictures in your bag. There is sufficient time to write both papers and study each of the test areas once. However, to get the Happy Ending you'll have to forego  studying for Emma's test.

On the day of the test you will return to the library. The test is 24 questions, three in each subject, from a pool of questions. There is no time limit on the questions, so you can search the web to find the answers if you don't know them. Odds are unless you possess a degree in literature you won't know enough answers.  If you studied you can use one of your study points to answer the question. If you roll back or reload a save it will affect your score. The only way to get a perfect score is to answer the questions correctly.

[h1]The Gallery[/h1]
There are three different Galleries where you can view content that you have unlocked from the game. There is the Images gallery with 81 images. The Video gallery with 15 videos. Most of the videos are paired, one early act and one later in the act. Finally there is the Replay gallery with 6 scene replays, just like they were in the game. 

[h1]Final Verdict[/h1]
AceX is a a developer to watch. Emma - In the Library is another game from Ace X with a high quality beautiful girl. There is just one, but she's worth it. Plus you may actually learn something about literature.

[url=https://steamcommunity.com/groups/Rkilroy]Join my group[/url]Back to school in visual novel form. This is a puzzle/quiz game where you are trying to answer fairly challenging quiz questions about literature, poetry etc... If you ace the test you will be rewarded in a very spicy way but if you fail you don't get the full reward, and don't cheat (the game will know if you cheat :D) yup... not saying I cheated but... 

Storyline is fairly simple but yet it fits the vibe and makes it a fairly relaxing experience. Render quality is good and the animations are pretty neat + Emma's character is smoking hot!

[/code][h1]What for save files are?[/h1]

WTF, lol. Can't run a previous save file to get better results in Emma's exam. Game stricts us off it, telling its not possible and "cheating". Thus, you should replay again and again to achieve what...

Even fictional girls rejects me :([code]For other Adult/Hentai themed reviews, please [url=https://store.steampowered.com/curator/40896498/]follow us at Lewd Gamer![/url][/code]

TL;DR : This game grades out at an A on the A-F scale. Read further for more details.

Emma in the Library is a short adult VN with a literary twist.

Graphically speaking, it's done in the style of the CGI renders which have become increasingly popular over the past five years. There's not a ton of variety, since the only girl you're actually interacting with is the titular (immature giggle) Emma. That being said, if you like the “naughty librarian” look, and are into blondes, she's very easy on the eyes. The sound is nothing to write home about, but given how short the game is, it's hard to really penalize the VN for this. It features all the standard QOL stuff you expect in a modern VN – auto skipping text you've already seen, a gallery option, etc. It does all the things it should, and it does them competently.

Where it gets creative is HOW you reach the various endings and scenes. The first part of the game features a bit of time management, where you have to decide whether to do college coursework, or study for Emma's exam. You naturally want to do good in school, since it's college, but you also want to do well on Emma's personal quiz, because, well..SEX. This section is extremely brief, because the dev realizes you're much more interested in getting to the adult portion of the game, and soon enough, you're taking a 24 question quiz on various genres of literature. Studying for her quiz will give you the ability to automatically answer her question, assuming you have “study points” in whatever genre she's asking about. However, you're also able to use google to get your answers, so HA HA. (And really, taking shortcuts on exams is part of the college experience, isn't it?)

Depending on how well you do, you'll get a different outcome. Do poorly, and she's not even going to be fully naked. Do well, and you're getting more the bonus plan on your encounter. No spoilers here, but the ending may not be what you're expecting.

A full run through the game is approximately a half hour, assuming you don't skip text, so the game is very short, even by adult game standards. However, there's definitely some replay to be had here. (You're not likely to get her bonus questions correct on the first run without a guide.) You're still likely to have seen everything there is to see in roughly two hours at most, and it's unlikely to be something you'll revisit once you're done. Price is definitely a factor here though, and even at full price, it's only $5 USD. It's completely worth it for this experience, and doubly so if you find it on sale. This one gets an A rating without any reservations.See kids, this is why you should study real hard.[h1]Too Long Didn't Read Version[/h1]

[/code][h1]What for save files are?[/h1]

WTF, lol. Can't run a previous save file to get better results in Emma's exam. Game stricts us off it, telling its not possible and "cheating". Thus, you should replay again and again to achieve what...

Even fictional girls rejects me :([code]For other Adult/Hentai themed reviews, please [url=https://store.steampowered.com/curator/40896498/]follow us at Lewd Gamer![/url][/code]

TL;DR : This game grades out at an A on the A-F scale. Read further for more details.

Emma in the Library is a short adult VN with a literary twist.

Graphically speaking, it's done in the style of the CGI renders which have become increasingly popular over the past five years. There's not a ton of variety, since the only girl you're actually interacting with is the titular (immature giggle) Emma. That being said, if you like the “naughty librarian” look, and are into blondes, she's very easy on the eyes. The sound is nothing to write home about, but given how short the game is, it's hard to really penalize the VN for this. It features all the standard QOL stuff you expect in a modern VN – auto skipping text you've already seen, a gallery option, etc. It does all the things it should, and it does them competently.

Where it gets creative is HOW you reach the various endings and scenes. The first part of the game features a bit of time management, where you have to decide whether to do college coursework, or study for Emma's exam. You naturally want to do good in school, since it's college, but you also want to do well on Emma's personal quiz, because, well..SEX. This section is extremely brief, because the dev realizes you're much more interested in getting to the adult portion of the game, and soon enough, you're taking a 24 question quiz on various genres of literature. Studying for her quiz will give you the ability to automatically answer her question, assuming you have “study points” in whatever genre she's asking about. However, you're also able to use google to get your answers, so HA HA. (And really, taking shortcuts on exams is part of the college experience, isn't it?)

Depending on how well you do, you'll get a different outcome. Do poorly, and she's not even going to be fully naked. Do well, and you're getting more the bonus plan on your encounter. No spoilers here, but the ending may not be what you're expecting.

A full run through the game is approximately a half hour, assuming you don't skip text, so the game is very short, even by adult game standards. However, there's definitely some replay to be had here. (You're not likely to get her bonus questions correct on the first run without a guide.) You're still likely to have seen everything there is to see in roughly two hours at most, and it's unlikely to be something you'll revisit once you're done. Price is definitely a factor here though, and even at full price, it's only $5 USD. It's completely worth it for this experience, and doubly so if you find it on sale. This one gets an A rating without any reservations.See kids, this is why you should study real hard.

Natural resources we once took for granted dwindled rapidly. Wars broke out in every nation to fight over the scraps that were left. The bombs ravaged what cities were left standing.

This is a casual game of finding differences + goddess CG. There are two pictures on the left and right in each level. On the right side of the level interface, there is a hint that how many differences between the two pictures and how many differences have been found. Click on the different points in any picture, and a green circle appears to indicate that the correct search has been made. If there is a difference, an error symbol indicates that it is incorrect. Find all the differences within the time limit to complete the level tasks. It's very difficult, it's really boring! 1 user reviewsI own several different puzzle games for my computer but I didn't have any games like this yet. I can usually spot several of the differences really quickly but there are usually one or two I have difficulty finding, and then there is a time limit. There are only 10 puzzles in this game. Some people may lose interest in the game after just beating all the puzzles one time, but people with a bad memory can enjoy playing it several times.I own several different puzzle games for my computer but I didn't have any games like this yet.

<h2 class="bb_tag">Story Background</h2>We travel through the universe to collect precious treasures. During our journey we enjoy the magnificent scenery of the universe, we will also encounter different enemies, we will create black holes and devour our enemies.<h2 class="bb_tag">Gameplay</h2>It is a relaxing game where when you choose two targets of the same color, they are connected by lightning and then destroyed by a black hole. When you destroy 100 targets, you win. <br><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2214860/extras/GIFyanshi.gif?t=1669270258" /><br>Of course, you have to finish within the allotted time to win, each game is limited to 5 minutes, and the shorter the time, the higher the rating you get. As I said, it's a simple little game to decompress.<br><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2214860/extras/GIF11.11.gif?t=1669270258" /><h2 class="bb_tag">Game Features</h2>To make the game more interesting, I made the game into 3D graphics. Unlike traditional 2D graphics, you can control your character to fly freely in the universe without being restricted. You'll need to keep connecting more targets during your flight, and you'll soon find it fun.<h2 class="bb_tag">More Game Modes</h2>Obstacle Mode: Add a random number of objects that are the same size and color as the target, but selecting them will not react in any way.<br><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2214860/extras/11.21GIF.gif?t=1669270258" /><br>Gem Mode: Eliminate 100 targets while collecting a randomly specified number of gems to win.<br><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2214860/extras/11.21GIF_1_.gif?t=1669270258" /><br>Vanishing Mode: Targets disappear randomly, making it difficult to lock onto them when there are fewer and fewer targets.<br><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2214860/extras/11.21GIF_2_.gif?t=1669270258" /><br>These game modes interfere with quick target selection, and it's not easy to beat a perfect score.<h2 class="bb_tag">More Fun</h2>As you win more and more, new maps are unlocked for you. In the new map, bosses will be spawned with different skills that will attack you at any time. You'll need to dodge boss skills in time, because if you get hit, your character will die instantly and you'll need to challenge again.<br><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2214860/extras/GIF.gif?t=1669270258" /><br><br>There are currently 4 maps in the game and 800 levels waiting for you to unlock.<h2 class="bb_tag">The Developers Want to Say</h2>This is my first indie game and I hope to make it even better. So I hope that players will be able to comment on this game after the experience, and I will do my best to improve it.<h2 class="bb_tag">You Can Contact Me</h2><h2 class="bb_tag">QQ：690845098</h2>

All rooms in Level 0 share the same superficial features, such as worn mono-yellow wallpaper, old moist carpet, scattered electrical outlets, and inconsistently-placed fluorescent lighting. Aside from these common features, no two rooms within the level are identical.<br><strong>It's almost as if the level existed to spite one's sense of reality.</strong><br><br>The fluorescent lighting present in Level 0 hums at a constant frequency. This buzzing is notably louder and more obtrusive than ordinary fluorescent lights, and examination of the fixtures to determine the source has been inconclusive thus far. Secondly, the substance lightly saturating the carpet cannot be consistently identified; it is not water, nor is it safe to consume.

<h2 class="bb_tag">Story:</h2>2.5 platformer game where player character is skeleton character. 9 different levels where player need solve different puzzles and make accurate jumps to reach star which is end of every level. Falling from a height kills player.<h2 class="bb_tag">Features:</h2>- 9 levels<br>- Skeleton character<br>- Puzzles<br>- Falling damage<br>- Steam achievements 2 user reviewsI don't know. Some levels were good to play and then there were some levels where I just wanted to punch this game back into unity asset store.

Levels with obstacles (especially those Karate Kid practice things) are annoying as hell. In one level they just push you off (at least for me) but you have to use them to platform and reach the next stage. Wasn't fun at all and kinda destroyed my positive opinion from the first few levels.

Fall damage is kinda  random as well (it seems). I sometimes died by falling a small distance while other times I could fall for ages and survive.

Wall-Jumping, oh man. I don't know, it also felt like random. Often times the character would stop jumping from the wall and just fall/slide down. Its really not that hard to press the jump button, so I certainly won't take the blame for having issues with it.. :D


The puzzle are ok, nothing to crazy which is good considering I hate puzzle games.



I mentioned more negative stuff but those are like 2-3 levels out of 9 (so far) which overshadowed my experience but overall its not a terrible bugged games like (Nash Racing).I don't know.

- A twisted plot. The game is set in the not too distant future.<br>- Three types of weapons are available to the player to solve problems.<br>- In addition to brute force the player can use stealth and tactical elements.<br>- Emphasis on realism (of course within the TDS genre). Your weapons, your actions in combat, the use of cover - it will all matter.<br><br><br>The world is on the verge of collapse. The once fertile lands have become barren. The sun, once a beacon of life, has become a sign of terror. The temperature is unbearable. Living things live in constant fear and seek shelter from the scorching light.

This is optional and can be disabled.<h2 class="bb_tag">Key features:</h2>🐝 2500+ bees<br><br>🖼️ 25 unique artworks<br>💡 ∞ Unlimited hints if you get stuck<br>♻️ Restore a small number of bees to a painting so you can find them again! <br>🍯 Additional bee related objects to find<br>🎵 Music and ambiance for each artwork<br>🏆 Achievements<br>⌨️ Use your keyboard to move/zoom in if you have no scroll wheel<br>💾 3x save slots<br>🗑️ Reset progress entirely and play again<br>🕒 Timer included to show how long you took to complete each level<br>🎁 New level unlocked each day (optional).<h2 class="bb_tag">Context:</h2>The brief was simple. I commissioned artists to create a fantasy Christmas/winter world, and hide as many bees as they can inside it. Now it’s your job to find them all! With 25 art pieces to choose from, and 2500+ bees, you will have a lot of searching to do.<h2 class="bb_tag">Controls:</h2>Use your mouse to move around the image and zoom in / out. When you find a bee, click it and it will disappear. You can also use WASD to move and the arrow keys to zoom.<h2 class="bb_tag">Difficulty:</h2>A full range of difficulty is included, but all levels start unlocked*, your progress is saved as you play, and you can use hints if you get stuck.<h2 class="bb_tag">Get immersed:</h2>Each painting has its own music and ambiance to help you connect with the world, as you search for all the bees.<h2 class="bb_tag">Replayable</h2>You can restore a small number of bees back into a painting so you can find them again! It’s much harder when there are only a few bees left (especially randomly). You can also use up to 3 save slots so you can replay without progress loss. Alternatively, you can reset your progress for the entire game if you’d like to start over.<br><br><br>*This is the ADVENT edition of the game. During December, all levels will lock. Each day, a new level will unlock (during 1 Dec to 25 Dec). You can disable this in the settings to immediately unlock all the levels. 3 user reviewsThis was a lot of fun, please do not do what I did and unlock all them at once. You will spoil the fun and the art work is amazing and attention grabbing. Finding the BEES was a lot of fun, and I highly recommend all the other games in the series. The DEVELOPER has done an incredible job in making the art unique and colourful, and enjoyable to admire. 

I do recommend this and the other 10 games in the series.

This is not your regular free-to-play match3 game. Laruaville has a lot of game mechanics you will not find in any other match3 game.

Despite being sent this game for free, I really did enjoy it and was legit terrified, intrigued and entertained throughout. Now, I won't lie- there is one puzzle that stumped me but that doesn't take away from my enjoyment of the game. 

Each monster is different as are the levels. They aren't lying when they tell you to be observant! Simply paying attention got me through- until that *one* part. Seems like the answer to that specific puzzle is randomly generated so a walkthrough didn't help me. BUT I will re-attempt to beat the game despite this. 

For this to be developed by a solo dev, it's an amazing game! I can't wait to see what else they come up with. I only played on Dream Mode but there is a Nightmare mode so the replayability is there. Also speedrunners will love this game!https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuW-XGaxsaA

This was great fun! It'll only last you around an hour but there's a lot of variety here. Scares, monsters and challenges will be awaiting you in every chapter. I just wish it was longer!The only problem with this game is the fact that is was too short! I wanna see what more this team can do!

Puzzles were really creative and intuitive. I hope this gets English text at some point so I can enjoy the story as well. Well worth the 30 or so minutes to play.Interesting... so you can like stop time but hmm that doesn't quite make sense since you can still interact with the world like it's in real time, it's almost like you can pause time in the normal area, move to an alternate parallel version of the normal area to continue the puzzle then switch back. Hmm truly interesting, well I'd definitely be interested if the full release comes out, this is a pretty cool game.美术和音乐都超棒的！
魔女都好可爱，credit的图都好好看噢！
喜欢这个游戏的世界观设定，期待后续的故事！

The girls are very cute as well which is always worth mentioning.

<GameName>Bewells</GameName>
<CONTENT>
Bewells is not exactly a classic three in a row game. You don't have to stack three identical stones in a row, but on the contrary, remove obstructing stones so that the stones that fall as a result form a horizontal or vertical row of identical stones. The game has a timer. Your time is also reduced when you remove a row of stones, and also added when a row is counted by the game. With the growth of points, move to another tier of difficulty and get less time for counted rows. When the timer reaches zero your game will be over and the points will be reset to zero.<br />
<br />
Minimal graphics<br />
Relaxed logic game 2 user reviewsThis seems like it would be a really nice variation of a Match 3 game that doesn't cost very much. Sometimes when I am trying to actually play the game it takes me way too long to try to find Jewels that would be good to remove and the game seem to move a lot slower than a normal Match 3 game like Bejeweled. It is worth purchasing just to give you more variety. Other games like Bejeweled 3, Candy Crush Saga, and Mirror are much better, but this might be worth buying at a low price if you really like puzzle games. There appear to be a few bugs that need to be fixed.Extremely low effort cash grab to try and sucker consumers who love Bejeweled and Candy Crush type games.  

- There is NO music in the background
- There is NO explanation on how to play the game or hints on how to play better anywhere
- There are NO settings in the game at all, no volume settings, no resolution or window mode settings.. nothing!
- There are no other modes to play, no extra power-ups to make each game interesting or rewarding

Why would you buy this low effort TRASH when you could just buy Bejeweled 3 right here on Steam instead which has ALL of the missing content I listed above?

My Score:  1.5 out of 10, and trust me when I say that's a generous score based on the obvious quick low effort cash grab attempt that this is.

NOT RECOMMENDED!  Buy any of the Bejeweled games here on Steam instead, even though they are 12+ years older, they are also at least 12 times better games for your money!

Massive enemy attacks are the main difficulty in the game. Fight back all the waves and defeat the plague!a game about pixel waifa. I don't know why I bought it, but I bought it and didn't return it. Therefore, I am satisfied. You can also buy if you like pixel waifs. Those who do not like - I do not advise.A very cool genre coupled with anime style give quality to the game. I recommend checking it out.
I played this genre in the afk arena and I quite liked it, but here is a full-fledged game and why not check it out?best runs/all skills unlocked here: https://youtu.be/GuT9gcmXxIE

Overall this is a fun game for 59 cents and is way more challenging then it looks it has some serious but minor flaws that are incredibly annoying though one if you try to cut back from the direction you're heading the character makes a C shaped looping movement which is annoying AF. You can't pause during a run which sucks. I really wish you could gain your xp from killing monsters while playing and you didn't get it all after death maybe give an xp bonus from how many waves, but at least let the player power up while playing having to die to power up sucks. Fire chicks burn screws up her scaling on her spells which makes the frost mage 100x better your line DOT spell with the fire mage the DOT gets linked to her burn which caps at .2 damage or something like with an initial 2 hits of the damage it should be doing while the Ice Mages DOT does how much damage it should be doing the whole time the enemies are on it. Also a way to skip the xp bar filling up at the end would be clutch as well. The achievements are broken also. The game does take a good bit of skill though and like I said it gets super challenging which makes it very entertaining definitely worth the price, but I hope the creators will fixed said previous issues.You are alone.
You are in the field.
Lots of monsters.
We must survive.
Very difficult.
Very scary.
No one knows where they came from and what they need.
Help the girl, she wants affection, and evil is everywhere.Well, a very simple game, with the simplest controls and very simple drawing.
We kill monsters and pass the level.
Of the minuses, I did not like the fact that the monsters do not have animations.The difficulty is for the average, I hope to see tougher levels in the upcoming update, and so the game is cool. Also waiting for new monsters and bosses of course.Keep up with good discounts

<CONTENT>
<u>INTRODUCING: <u><i>The Outsider TD</i></u></u><br><br>The Outsider TD is a top down view tower defense game. In this new take on the classic tower defense style game, you take on the role of Danny: A down on his luck fella who gets involved in a local gang when a much needed promise of fast cash arises. The &quot;towers&quot; will be your crew members, each of which will have a unique weapons and upgrade options. Place your crew members strategically around the paths in front of your stash houses to maximize their efficiency against the waves of enemies that seek to thwart you.<br>As you prove your stash house protection capabilities against rival gangs and the DEA, you get more responsibilities like bigger stash houses with more stash to protect. But with more to protect comes more unwanted attention and more enemies to fend off.<br><br><br>Much much more to come as development of the game progresses. We are in the early stages of development but will keep updating and posting as we have new exciting stuff to show. Join us in the discussion forum and stay updated on the news

On top of that, you must also figure out most of the rules by yourself, deducing them from the carefully crafted sequence of more than 90 puzzles, contained in the main storyline, 2 expansions and many off-page enigmas.

In Gravity Magician you have to go through a dungeon as a magician who can control the gravity of small objects. Move rocks, turn on ground plates, and avoid traps to advance further in the dungeon.<br><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2206580/extras/1.gif?t=1669739422" /><br>Game Features: 15 levels of levels testing your intelligence, Pretty pixel art, Unusual magic gravity mechanics. 3 user reviewsI wanted to like the game based on the art style but there's not much of a puzzle aspect to the game. A majority of the "puzzles" in the game are made significantly harder due to the inability to simply just drop a rock where it currently is. The turrets are also made extremely more frustrating due to their inaccurate nature, meaning that intended strategies to hold a rock to defend yourself become ineffective due to the turret not even aiming directly at you. The shots also behave differently depending on whether you are above or below the turret meaning you'll get killed plenty of times as a result.

Even if the game does receive a few QoL changes, it doesn't really change the fact that there's not much puzzle-solving to the game.[h1]Tired hands? - Sorcery![/h1]
 ⠀⠀Hard times have come, because the powers of the magician are not unlimited. An interesting puzzle game where we are waiting for 15 levels of puzzles.

The game itself lacks normal animations and good effects.
The game is played quickly, but I was delayed for a long time.The likeness of a red ant with three limbs is terrorised by humans. He has no choice but to use his superpowers to repel the enemy's attacks. The game is enjoyable, not stressful.It was quite difficult to play, oddly enough, you need to keep up quickly before you are killed. But the complexity only adds interest to the game and that's good. While on sale, I advise you to takeKalzoon is a 2D shooter where you take on the role of a powerful being whose planet has been invaded. Use your skills and deal with short-sighted colonizers.Pretty challenging gameplay, but interesting in its idea of a game. In it you have to kill people while fighting for a powerful alien.Great game in the vampire like genre. Great gameplay, awesome levels and retro atmosphere reminiscent of childhood, and the music is just perfect. This is my favorite genre in the game and I'm glad that there are more and more games like this, thanksthat game have a more common with old console games, like sega, Nintendo and others. same pixel graphics, same stylistic and simply gameplay. 
here you will improve your skill in manipulate with hero, think what is the better method to kill all enemies not your game backpack :D

<GameName>Cloud House</GameName>
<CONTENT>
In the midst of the 2020 pandemic, when performing arts spaces were forced shut, a team of creative and tech collaborators began a mammoth task to document Centre 42's beloved blue house as its own virtual world. Through the process of photogrammetry, we captured a digital rendering of the building. The desire stemmed from preserving memories, but it led to the curiosity in exploring and expanding opportunities to create theatre and build community beyond physical spaces.<br />
<br />
The Cloud House multi-player journey brings the player to a futuristic rendering of Centre 42. It is an invitation to explore its new imagining and the wider virtual world. You will encounter our very first theatrical experience titled 'Love Letters to 42', a single-player filmic story shot in 2020 that captures the history of pre-pandemic C42 at 42 Waterloo Street.<br />
<br />
In Cloud House, audiences can encounter arts performances, experiences, workshops and interact with artists and other audiences. It is also an invitation and opportunity for digital artists, theatre-makers to imagine their works to be presented in this space. The content, programmes, interactivity functions are being imagined and built as ‘modules’ and updates along the way after this initial launch. The digital possibilities are endless!<br />
<br />
Please note: the multiplayer environment features bright neon lights and special effects, discretion is advised.

Each of the 4 choices offers a different special ability (listed on each card) such as never having to discard or piercing through your opponent's protection with every damage dealt.<br><br>Each player starts with the same 10 starter cards. Use the coins you draw into your hand to acquire new cards from the Keepers Row. Each card may give you health, damage, protection, more coins, or a combination of these. There are also many Keepers you can acquire that will allow you to do special things (written on each card). Some special rules include refreshing the keepers row - discarding up to all 5 of the drawn keepers and drawing new ones from the deck into the keepers row, combining cards in your discard pile, or immediately gaining spells into your discard pile. Cards may also require you to discard, or may allow you to draw an extra card, or even make your opponent discard a card (these are denoted as icons on the bottom of each card).<br><br>The first player to bring their opponent to their knees, down to 0 health, wins!

This is a game that takes forever to get to a point of some kind of challenge . Several levels won and Im just bored. Repetitive! . Its not a BAD game per say its just , well its just There . The Music is pretty decent .  #2. You are seriously charging $29.99 for this? ive seen better Free Games with the same idea but with better controls , and faster gameplay .. I can not recommend this .Changed my review to negative as the price went up to 30$.  This game is not worth 30$.  2$ at the very most.

Bought this game for a couple cents right after it came out, cuz I thought the little bang-bang guy looked cute.  Gameplay is quite fun, and the weapon variety keeps the gameplay from getting boring or repetitive.  While the game did release with a handful of bugs, the dev team was quick to fix them.

My only qualms with this game: enemy variety is lacking (there's just one enemy type, who comes in two very similar colors), and the lack of story is abysmal.  Seriously, who is this bang-bang guy?  Why is he in a furry village?  Is that hose thing his nose, or just coming out of his right eye socket?  The world needs to know!

I also wish there was more to this game in general - bosses, new areas, more weapons and playable characters to unlock… I’d love that, as unlikely as it is that such an update would happen.

Other than that, great game, 10/10II GET TO KILL MEN (and women i don't discriminate)If the game was $0.50 like when I got it then it is worth it just to say you have this game. I purchased it three times; one for myself and two for friends.

I do not recommend this game so people do not pay $30 for a game where you can get all the upgrades in less than half an hour.Oh my god.. This is truly the best game I've ever seen... How I love and adore these hentai games with furry... Simply amazing! For all lovers like me, I recommend, condolences to the rest
Great game but it got over priced somehow it was 50 centsthe game is cool, run his enemies into meat.

There are a huge number of guns to choose from . infinite mobs (infinite mode) well, I took a sweet price at discounts, (You are recommended to take it also only at discounts,)Game for the evening mb.In this game we have to kill furry with different weapons.

I do not recommend this game so people do not pay $30 for a game where you can get all the upgrades in less than half an hour.Oh my god.. This is truly the best game I've ever seen... How I love and adore these hentai games with furry... Simply amazing! For all lovers like me, I recommend, condolences to the rest
Great game but it got over priced somehow it was 50 centsthe game is cool, run his enemies into meat. I understand this game is about the destruction of forest dwellers and bazookas))) it's very cool to play, I can't even tear myself away, I was dragged into this game. for that kind of money, it's a cool game, even better than doom.A furry killer who kills everything that moves what you wanted and dreamed of all in one game. There are a huge number of guns to choose from . infinite mobs (infinite mode) well, I took a sweet price at discounts, (You are recommended to take it also only at discounts,)Game for the evening mb.In this game we have to kill furry with different weapons. The game has a system for upgrading weapons for coins, which we will receive for killing. Good graphics and meme idea. I recommend

<CONTENT>
CyberBrick brings the classic brick breaking action games of the 1980s and 1990s into the modern era with plenty of frantic fun, wild chaos, and plain ol' good times to the max!<br />
<br />
* Points are scored more by catching gems that fall from the broken bricks than simply breaking the bricks from afar.<br />
<br />
* Bricks sporadically drop both positive and negative power-ups and de-buffs and it's up to you to learn what drops do what.<br />
<br />
* Excellent play earns you extra balls that multiply your score exponentially! <br />
<br />
* Enemies can come in to taunt you and even re-spawn bricks you've previously destroyed!<br />
<br />
* Kill the enemies by becoming precise and accurate with your ball reflections before they rebuild the entire brick wall!<br />
<br />
* Rewarding gameplay ensures a high replay value that will likely have you playing again and again!<br />
<br />
* More features, gameplay modes, levels, and game mechanics will be released over time as more and more players play the game.

PositiveThis reminds me of the Jet Set Radio and Viewtiful Joe days of gayming.The idea of this game is super cool, and the artstyle is amazing, I can tell a lot of effort went into it

Right now the physics feel a bit floaty though, I don't feel like I'm really in control of the character

Will definitly return to the game if updated, im really looking forward to where this goes!I am ABSOLUTELY IN LOVE with the art in this game, in my eyes it's super unique and entertaining and I could never get tired of it. The way the colors pop out really stand out to me too, it just gives the game a much more vibrant look. The music factors in with this positive review too, it gives me nostalgia. I also love the idea of having something fantasy related tie in with something like skateboarding, I just think it's a super cool and one-of-a-kind concept. Although, it's incredibly easy to not die as there are items in the game that spawn in various places that instantly regenerate your health. It's fairly easy to acquire an outrageous damage boost as well, in some areas even you can sit there and keep the damage multiplier.the witch was definitely punkwitchThe game is short, and could do with more than 1 level, and its not necessarily challenging as it becomes super easy to refill your health completely with heart pickups. The dialog boxes appear while the game is playing, and it becomes difficult to play and read at the same time and some areas allow you to infinitely loop around and gain an insane damage modifier.
But after all the negatives, this game is fun. The artstyle is cool and unique and doesn't distract on what you're even looking at. The sounds and music are good, and the character designs for the player and the enemy's look great. The game plays well and feels snappy, and there is not too much going on to get lost.

<CONTENT>
Place yourself in the shoes of Johnny with his typical teenage problems. Eat lots of beans, discover the hidden abilities of your body and learn to utilize them to progress in a colorful cartoony universe of Cuana. Master techniques and moves that will help you weasel out of any situation and become a real winner in any scenario. Help Johnny succeed in his oneway relationship with Monica by unleashing smelly hell upon the unwary and treating them with some unexpected gassy surprises such are ordinary raspberries, fart mines, and fart bombs.<h2 class="bb_tag">A VERY GASSY STORY</h2><br>Johnny is a teenager who hates healthy food. His mother forces him to eat beans since a certain psychologist on TV said that mothers need to introduce their kids to a healthy diet. After eating the canned beans, Johnny discovers the hidden abilities of his organism. Now he commands a very powerful weapon of mass destruction... Hmm... Farts... Through mastering this newly acquired superpower, Johnny aims to win the heart of his long-time crush Monica. However, each and every time it doesn't work as expected. Will he manage to overcome his problems, defeat his worst enemy Greg, and make Monica fall in love with him? It's up to you to find out.<h2 class="bb_tag">LEVELS</h2><br>The game features 6 levels - <strong>Bus</strong>, <strong>School</strong>, <strong>Grocery Store</strong>, <strong>Cafe</strong>, <strong>Airport</strong>, and <strong>Airplane</strong> levels. <br><br>Some levels require Johnny to fill the room with unpleasant smells without anyone noticing.

Each level has unique conditions for winning.<h2 class="bb_tag">POTENT WEAPONS</h2><br>Command 3 potent weapons at your disposal - <strong>Ordinary Fart</strong>, <strong>FartBomb</strong>, and <strong>FartMine</strong>.<br><br>Ordinary fart comes in handy to relieve pressure from your stomach, cause havoc, surprise other characters in the game, and even open doors.<br><br>FartBomb can knock out NPCs at a distance. It requires beans to pump enough pressure into your digestive system.<br><br>FartMine is more for tactical players who want to get rid of NPCs that walk around in the game through covert operations. Delivering FartMine requires beans too.<h2 class="bb_tag">DIFFICULTY LEVELS</h2>I can say for sure that you can win Cuana on easy-peasy and normal difficulties. However, even I - the developer of the game, have no idea if it's even possible to win on Gas Bomb difficulty. You gotta find out that for yourself! 3 user reviewsGreat little game. Me and my little brother are having fun playing it.

There are sparkly, mystical sound effects when you do anything of importance, the HUD -while minimalist- evokes simple arcade titles, and the world itself -floating unchained in an ethereal void- makes it feel like you're playing on the edge of imagination, pressing against the border of reality. You may have seen these art assets and ideas before, but WITCH'S knows how to use them really, really well. It all feels like playing with tiny figurines, as a child, and strongly evokes the Toybox Takeover game mode from Disney Infinity, especially given the overhead perspective.

When we strip away the romanticism, we have a light action-rpg here, but like the presentation, it excels with what little it has. The level design is thoughtful, with tight corridors that encourage skilled movement, where you quickly learn to prioritize your resources and tackle enemies in the most efficient order. Each encounter feels like its own lighting fast puzzle, bolstered by your limited number of ranged weapons, and how swiftly the enemies perish. Your health refills on its own, but only to half, ensuring each fight is tense, but also gives you a fair shot at victory.

The game is currently in Early Access, and can be finished in about 30 minutes, but what's here is really good.WITCH'S is one of the most videogamey fantasy games, and I can't help but admire its earnest style.

Green Garden is an asset flip, what Valve calls a "fake game".  The "developer", Rosa Special Studio, took the [url=https://github.com/Shit-Just-Got-Real-Studios/Jigsaw]Jigsaw[/url] Unity game template/demo from the real developers, Sh*t-Just-Got-Real Studios, changed the name and added a couple (about 3) stock/low effort images of "anime girls", and dumped the result onto Steam.  They're attempting to scam people into buying this, so they can get your money for someone else's work.

It gets worse... the Jigsaw Github template has been shamelessly dumped on Steam by Rosa Special Studio a whopping 62 times.  That's got to be a world record for the most asset flip scams from the same template.  Here's some of them so you can see for yourself:

Take a look... these are all [i]exactly the same game![/i]

"Jigsaw" is just a free Github jigsaw template for Unity mobile apps, and doesn't have any merit as a proper, fully fledged PC game, so this lame copy of that template is impossible to recommend.

Asset flips don't involve any professional game development.  All Rosa Special Studio does here is change the puzzle images and then dump the exact same game with different images onto Steam as a cash grab.  Asset flips like this are harmful to the gaming industry and to Steam because they reduce the visibility that sincerely made indie games should have, and make it harder for gamers to find real games from genuine developers.

Don't reward this morally bankrupt, unethical behaviour from Rosa Special Studio.

It gets worse... the Jigsaw Github template has been shamelessly dumped on Steam by Rosa Special Studio a whopping 61 times.  That's got to be a world record for the most asset flip scams from the same template.  Here's some of them so you can see for yourself:

Take a look... these are all [i]exactly the same game![/i]

"Jigsaw" is just a free Github jigsaw template for Unity mobile apps, and doesn't have any merit as a proper, fully fledged PC game, so this lame copy of that template is impossible to recommend.

Asset flips don't involve any professional game development.  All Rosa Special Studio does here is change the puzzle images and then dump the exact same game with different images onto Steam as a cash grab.  Asset flips like this are harmful to the gaming industry and to Steam because they reduce the visibility that sincerely made indie games should have, and make it harder for gamers to find real games from genuine developers.

Don't reward this morally bankrupt, unethical behaviour from Rosa Special Studio.
