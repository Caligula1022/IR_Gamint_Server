All Rosa Special Studio does here is change the puzzle images and then dump the exact same game with different images onto Steam as a cash grab.  Asset flips like this are harmful to the gaming industry and to Steam because they reduce the visibility that sincerely made indie games should have, and make it harder for gamers to find real games from genuine developers.\n\nDon't reward this morally bankrupt, unethical behaviour from Rosa Special Studio/Unreal Quality Games.\nThis is a pretty good quality jigsaw puzzle game at a low price, but there are only five puzzles which is less than some of my other games. A couple of the pictures are really attractive. There are features like allowing you to separate the edge pieces from the other pieces."

The rest of the players are employees who's job it is to stop the Blight from escaping the facility.

If the timer ends with at least one employee still alive, the employees will win. The Blight has heightened vision and can see well in dark places along with incredible strength that allows it to snap the neck of any employee in an instant. Both the Blight &amp; employees can climb and crouch into unique and crafty hiding places using the climbing system.",

The impact of the trillion-ton meteorite was enormously powerful and caused a worldwide ecological disaster. This catastrophe caused the last known mass extinction at the turn of the Mesozoic Era and ended the dominance of the dinosaurs. The impact created a crater 80 kilometres wide and 30 kilometres deep. The impact released enormous energy, resulting in fires, earthquakes and megatsunamis. The worst effects of the impact lasted 30 years. The impact winter that followed the impact lasted more than a century. The entire planet was affected. The disaster wiped out 75 percent of life on Earth.<br><br>By 2190, scientists had deciphered the dinosaurs' DNA and learned to reconstruct it. In 2220, the technology of traveling at the speed of light was discovered and successfully tested.  The exploration and settlement of planets beyond our solar system began.<br><br>In 2362, a private company, ACTAS, found a planet that is 85% similar to our earth from 66 million years ago. The planet was named Hope. The company decided to reconstruct the dinosaur fauna and use it for commercial purposes. The entire planet was declared a protected reserve. Only paying visitors are allowed on the planet. Some private companies have not recognised this move by ACTAS. The company expects huge profits from this unique attraction.<br><br>The first step was to build a space station in the orbit of Hope. Samples of several dozen dinosaurs were brought to the station. The entire planet has been fairly well mapped. Locations were selected for dinosaur settlement where there is less of an abundance of alien species inhabiting the planet. The company has appointed you director of the planetary colonization project. Your task is to build a functional and harmonious fauna on the planet and maximize the company's profits.

Have not completed entire game, but I am trying to make sure I find all the coins on each level before continuing on.  Levels grow in difficulty and length.  With the programmable robot having a slight difference in each run, your programming decisions become more and more important for the first several lines of codes as those make a huge change by the end of the level.  Not a game I thought I would enjoy, but have found myself playing it all the time when I'm just sitting at the desk.  I really enjoy the way the scenery changes as the levels progress.

    "reviews": "2 user reviewsEDIT: I had to change this not NOT recommended.\nWhy? Not the game, although my thoughts have not changed, and about 4 hours is about all the \"playing\" there is.\nIt is because the dev has a very similar game, also at a cost that, is in the same state. If they had one game and were working on it? Sure, pay to get it. But this seems like a copy/paste cash grab, which is super sad, since the bones are there..\n\nEDIT2: The devs response did not shine any light on why they released 2 games that are 20% complete, at the same time. My recommendation stays the same. Are you committed to making a good game, or making 2 games that are not really finished and make 2x as much cash? Pretty clear which the devs chose.\n\nThis is super beta material. The instructions (in English at least) are not that helpful and only 1 page saying not a lot.\nLots of stuff is not obvious, like only one of the \"team\" fights at once.\nThere is no scroll bar on the left, so it is VERY possible you will not notice there are more things to build (looking at you, Uranium!)\nI would say I am half way through, and it has got to the point of my income being well high enough to just get each element, spam the buildings, get the next and repeat. Some balancing required.\nThere is very little in the way of decisions to make. Just make all the things until you need something (has happened twice in 4 hours...), go swap something over and you are done.\n\nSo why am I recommending it? Has good bones, I have enjoyed the 4 hours I have into it, and will probably \"finish\" it in another 4 or so. Tomorrow. :DGood idea for the game but the game is about 20% finished now. There are a lot of different resources but only few of them have specialized machinery, the rest are just copy-paste. Balance is non-existent, some things don't make sense. Why positive review then? Because I enjoyed playing it for 5 hours until it became obvious that it is not finished yet. So if you want to try it for few hours without expecting a full game, I recommend it.\n\nI am not sure if it will be ever finished as their other game - Mining Copper was released two weeks before this one and also has reviews that say it is unfinished (I didn't play it myself) and instead of finishing one game dev released another.\n\nSo what is this game about? There are three parts in it: mining, making and exploration.\n\nMining:\nYou have several resources and each one has a machinery chain which basically starts from drilling holes, transforming them into tunnels, digging resources, transporting them, processing them into final product (either green/blue energy or just some resource which you store to use in other chains). Each stage in chain produces next resource and can also produce gold. You use gold to upgrade speed and yield of each stage. Some chains don't make sense, for example, you load impure coal into truck making truckload of coal, then unload truckload of coal into more impure coal at warehouse basically making impure coal out of nothing.\n\nMaking:\nYou use green energy to create 5 types of units. Each unit has rank and level. You produce rank 1 units. You can upgrade their level with gold and you can combine two of the same rank into one of the higher rank of the same type. So to create rank 9 unit you need to make 256 rank 1 units. After rank 9 it requires 4 units of the previous rank to make another, so 1024 rank 1 for rank 10, 4096 for rank 11, etc. After you upgrade a unit to a new level with cash you need to craft enough units to at least get it to the same rank before you can use it, luckily if you combine few units, one of which has higher level resulting level will be the highest of them.\n\nExploration:\nYou choose 3 unit types and the first unit of those types (usually the strongest unless you reordered them) goes into battle. Each level initially has 10 enemies, one of which is the boss (which increases by 20 each 5 levels). Rightmost unit attacks the enemy, then central unit attacks the enemy, leftmost unit attacks the enemy, and then finally enemy attacks your rightmost unit, so use tanky unit at the rightmost position. If enemy level is higher than your total level of three units then enemy attacks first otherwise you can just kill them before they get a move if your units are strong enough. You get sources of resources as a reward for exploration which are used to produce initial resource in Mining production chains. The further you get the more rare resource sources you find but because there is nothing special about those resources it is still better to just produce initial resources to convert them to green energy and gold. Yes you get more chains but because they cost more to upgrade they end up slower so increase is not very noticable.\n\nAnd so that's it. Mine resources, produce green energy and gold, spend gold on upgrades, spend energy on crafting new units, combine units, fight."

Suppressive fire might pin an enemy in place, but the ammunition used up may leave you ill-equipped to fight the next encounter effectively<br><br><img src=\"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2209140/extras/Explosion_-_Resized.gif?t=1669149424\" /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">DRIVE RESTORED VEHICLES</h2>It's a big world out there. To get around you will need better transportation than your legs can provide. One of the things setting Ascent of Ashes apart from other games of this genre is the ability to restore and drive vehicles.<br><br><br><img src=\"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2209140/extras/Vehicles_-_Resized.gif?t=1669149424\" /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">LEAD YOUR SURVIVORS</h2>Each survivor has their own unique personality and motivations. As colony leader it is up to you to find and recruit capable survivors to fill gaps in your roster against ever increasing challenges. Can you keep everyone happy, secure and motivated?<br><br><br><img src=\"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2209140/extras/Campfire_-_Resized.gif?t=1669149424\" /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">EXPLORE A STRANGE NEW WORLD</h2>You will find yourself in an expansive, procedurally generated world filled with different biomes and points of interest. To survive the post-apocalypse you'll have to brave the pre-collapse ruins and the many dangers that they hold.<br><br><br><img src=\"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2209140/extras/Floaters_-_Resized.gif?t=1669149424\" /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">CHALLENGE A DYNAMIC AI</h2>It's not enough to just have an in-depth combat system with a variety of mechanics. You also need opponents capable of using those mechanics to challenge you. Enemies will possess varying degrees of intelligence. Taking on a disorganized band of raiders will play very differently from fighting a squad of well-trained Remnant soldiers.<br><br><br><img src=\"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2209140/extras/Dynamic_AI_-_Resized.gif?t=1669149424\" /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">FROM THE ORGINAL CREATORS OF COMBAT EXTENDED</h2>Combining the deep simulation of classic post-apocalyptical survival titles with the tactical challenge of classic real time and turn-based gems, the original creators of RimWorld's heralded <strong>Combat Extended</strong> mod present a fresh take on the colony sim genre that emphasizes exploration, tight balance and strategic gameplay.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">MODDING SUPPORT</h2>Our team has its roots in mod-making and we've been fortunate to have been part of many great modding communities over the years. That's why with Ascent of Ashes, we want to give something back to those communities. We're building the game's engine from the ground up to be easily extendable, and thanks to our extensive experience in creating mods ourselves we know exactly what kind of support mod-makers need. Ascent of Ashes is a game developed by modders, for modders.",

    "desc": "In Raiders of Ruin, you guide a group of 5 champions sent on a quest to seize the throne of the Underworld itself. Along the way, you will encounter many deadly bosses and engage in challenging, strategic turn-based combat. You decide how to build your party, mixing-and-matching between 9 different classes, each with drastically different strengths and weaknesses. You can change classes any time, so experiment frequently to craft the perfect strategy for each enemy!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Features</h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Over <strong>40 boss fights,</strong> each with their own unique mechanics. Expect multiple phases, colourful gimmicks, and ruthless attacks. <br></li><li><strong>No game-overs:</strong> Your progress is saved after every battle. Defeat simply means a chance to try again. <br></li><li>Study your enemies ahead of time by viewing the <strong>Boss Log,</strong> where you can find a record of your greatest foes and a description of their attacks. You must prepare to counter their strategies with a plan of your own!<br></li><li>Class-based combat system that's simple to learn, hard to master. <strong>Swap classes before any battle</strong> to arm yourself for the fight ahead. Find a combo that works for you and stick to it, or experiment frequently to find the perfect squad. <br></li><li><strong>9 main classes to choose from.</strong> Need more firepower? Swap that Paladin for a Wizard. Expecting a long fight? Try poisoning your foe with a Rogue.<br></li><li><strong>Multiple subclasses</strong> for most classes, providing even more customization. Should your Ranger be a Hunter, or a Survivalist?<br></li><li><strong>Innovative rematch system</strong> that replaces traditional level-grinding. Instead of fighting normal enemies repeatedly, you will occasionally be given the opportunity to rematch a boss of your choosing for a second chance at its rewards (though this system is entirely optional). <br></li><li><strong> MIDI soundtrack</strong> inspired by PC games of the early 2000's, with some modern twists. <br></li><li>A backpack that might be alive?</li></ul><br>-------------------------------------------------<br><br><i>&quot;I won't waste my time trying to plead with you.
